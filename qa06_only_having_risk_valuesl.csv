According to MEL 27-65-01  Maintenance action is required, but not present at VIE. Additionaly MEL 32-44-01 simple (M) was completed by me and F/O. With the consideration to MEL remarks/exceptions T/O is not conducted from wet runway and both pairs of GND SPLR are to be operative. Since it was raining therefore departure rwy was wet and also IB GND SPLR FAULT sts msg was present I as the commander can not go bellow MEL. I called LMLD and performed the A/C restart on maintenance request, but that didn’t cleared the status. He explained that until the fault system is not fixed by maintenance or the rwy gets dry we are AOG. 
Handling agent was informed about situation and explained to him that we can not perform the flight with this A/C under this conditions and that we are now waiting for futher instructions from our ops.
The agent called their ops and he explained the situation in german language to them.

After few minutes adr ops called me (12:27z) and ‘explained’ to me that Austrian ops called our ops with question how can I as the commander cancel the flight and complained (quote):’’that we have most probably some crazy pilot on the left seat’’.
I talked immediately with handling agent and explained to him what happened and he called his ops once again with additional explanation.

That was quite disturbing and very frustrating for me. I called fleet chief to explain him the situation. 
We called LMLD one more time at 12:56z and we found out from them that extra flight is organised from LJU with maintenance on board to fix the malfunction.

We still waited for Adr ops to get any news, so we decided to call them again at 13:21z. There was no response.

We finally received the call from them at 13:50 with information that S5-AAU is dispatched to VIE and that we will perform the flight OS549 and OS550 with the new A/C.

CPT was pilot flying and as the indication went into the red range he reduced the thrust setting of the left engine to idle. We declared PAN PAN to Vienna Radar and requested to return to LJU; we proceeded with a descent towards DOL VOR. We checked QRH for the issue - as the required action (idle/reduced thrust) was already executed and L ENG oil pressure and oil quantity indications were in normal range hence, according to QRH, we left the L ENG thrust setting at idle (no shutdown). Initially the temperature was still rising reaching its peak at 176 C before it began slowly and steadily to fall back.

During descent the indication was slowly dropping back to the normal range (green range achieved in couple of minutes) and as L ENG oil pressure and oil quantity indications were all the time in normal range we decided, in compliance with QRH, not to shut down the L ENG and to execute a normal approach and landing with flaps 45 and using both engines in normal thrust setting during final approach (= normal configuration).  

By the time we were established on final track (LJU ILS30) the indication had a normal/usual value - around 95 C. Still, as a precaution, we decided to use idle thrust on L ENG until about the last 7 miles of the approach, then we went to normal thrust setting on both engines.

The F/O (PF) called out “wind shear,” overreacted and exaggeratedly proceeded with the wind shear escape drill thus exerting further backward pressure on the control column and excessively increasing the pitch. I called out “pitch” and almost immediately after “speed.” As the F/O corrections came instantly no further callouts deemed necessary and I retained my focus on the speed increase. With the attitude brought roughly within the stabilization criteria F/O engaged the A/P. ALT hold vertical mode also engaged. At that time it was perceived that ALT hold was erroneously depressed by the F/O missing the AP ENG pushbutton but just today during a missed approach we noticed that S5-AAZ FCP sometimes inadvertently engages ALT hold with the AP engagement. (See applicable missed approach report – 08.04.2019 / LGL 9412). At that relatively high climb rate it was proper operation of the AP to generate a descent towards the overshot marked altitude. I called out “you are descending” to which the F/O replied “I see” and engaged the V/S thus reestablishing a normal climb out. As the descent was arrested within about 100’ the GPWS “DON’T SINK” didn’t trigger and was not supposed to.

I took it as an information, since there were not many passengers expected.
When boarding completed, the man from the gate came to the acft to inform me that the boarding is completed and that there might be some pax on board that were not counted at the gate. It was a strange information for me! I got the information from cabin crew that we had 84 pax on board.  So I went downstairs to ask the ramp agent about the number of pax. She got the loadsheet already prepared with 81 pax! 
At that point I instructed my cabin crew to start searchig for the 3 ""smuggled""pax.
With the help of the ramp agent and the boarding staff (only by phone with the ramp agent), we found the three pax: Mr. Rorijs, Stakul and Vrabec, who passed the gate and have been not counted as boarded.
We asked those pax what happened and all of them told us the same reason: ""When I put the boarding pass on the barcode reader there was a red light and luod sound started. But the man at the gate told me that I can pass, so I proceeded to board the acft!""
On my opinion this kind of boarding staff behaviour is not acceptable and risk is not acceptable!

waypoint we got further clearance to climb FL160. Passing FL110 I have started to accelerate from IAS 210 to IAS 290. ATC asked us about our Rate of climb and gave us NO rate of climb restrictions. In the meanwhile we asked ATC about further routing after Gosti waypoint, because flight planned route turns towards LONTA waypoint which is behind and would mean turn backwards. ATC gave us shortcut after GOSTI fly heading 300°. I have preset the heading bug to 300° and continue flying in navigation mode with FMS  source. Because the turn between GOSTI and LONTA is quite sharp, FMS started early turn - LONTA was now to waypoint . At that time I have engaged HDG mode and Aircraft started to turn to Heading 300°. When we were established on heading 300°, ATC questioned why are we positioned 4 NM north of GOSTI waypoint, that there is Traffic at FL130. At that time we had rate of climb 2000ft per min and were well above FL 130. At no time ATC gave as no Rate of Climb instructions or information about the traffic. We had the traffic on TCAS and it was shown as Other traffic on MFD . 
In my opinion, the route cause for this is the Flight Planed Route, GOSTI 2D departure, GOSTI DCT LONTA UL608 DOLEV.

Nemudoma je prekinil točenje goriva in me  obvestil o iztekanju, ob čemer sva takoj ugasnila APU in zahtevala tehnično pomoč ter posip luže goriva pod repom.

Mehanik AAT je zadevo hitro pregledal in ugotovil, da gre verjetno za iztekanje iz drenažnega voda okoli APU gorivnih cevi.
Od tu naprej pa so se začele ""komunikacijske"" težave.
Mehanik nama potrdi, da  ""dokaj sigurno predvideva omenjeno iztekanje iz APU"" in da lahko tega vpišejo v HIL kot U/S in je letalo plovno.

Having to operate a joint SKP-SOF-LJU flight with upset passengers who mostly were not aware of a merged flight and later on still having to carry mostly the same passengers towards FRA has prooven extremely tiring. During the whole day I did not even get the half an hour rest for a meal that is obligatory under the workers' sights. Furthermore I have to express that the CRJ900 AFA/B/C series are having a cabin which is too small for my height, adding my shoes, I keep hitting the oxygen mask compartment above my jumpseat every single time and it is unavoidable, throughout the rest of the plane I keep having a bad posture, which just adds to the fatigue factor. Not being able to stand in the galley is the worst as well. Throughout the day I kept noticing my lack of concentration and towards the end even lack of coordination. On the last flight of the day from LJU to TIA, had to even change to aircraft type, during the flight I simply felt drained. 

For the next day on 23.8. the crew planner made another change to the roster to have another set of 5 flights in one day. However already on the flight to from Tirana to Ljubljana, I felt like I cannot operate anymore. I couldn't concentrate anymore and even move properly, I couldn't even perform the commercial duties well as I have accidently returned too much money to passengers. All the fatigue made me call unfit to fly.

When I called the dispatch he was also in agony that I can't do this 15min before the flight and that he has no stand-by at all and today's and tomorrow's flights that are fully booked will be cancelled all because of me. and that if I do so I will make a total mess. He insisted on me performing the flight and talk with the CrewControl the next morning to resolve my further duty-flights the next morning. I gave in the pressure and despite my bad state performed and operated the flight to TIA at 23:34. I felt very fatiqued and my legs hurt so much so I have literally crashed into bed as soon as we have arrived to the hotel in Tirana around 02.00am. 
I have returned from a 12 day sick leave on the 22nd of August, but planning to such extreme level at full level and maximum FDP time planned already in advance, and coming to work from the sick leave, when the body is not yet fully generated and work to such maximum point is far from being safe!! Another problem are the night flights for which no STBY is available and even though you feel bad and tired you have apparently no choice but to perform the flight at all costs. This rises a very serious safety question!! 
Overplanning and planning to extremes are happening way to often ... especially after coming from a sick leave ... sometimes it feels like the punishment for being sick.
My superiors have already been informed about the incident. ",1,20

At approx 8000ft AGL I called CCM1 if there is also any smell present in the cabin. At that moment they didn't realised anything abnormal so I and F/O agreed to continue nevertheless the air felt very irritating. During the climb situation improved but after landing at VIE, first officer and I felt nose iritation and burning feeling in the eyes. 
During the turn around time at VIE I asked the complete crew if they feel ok and if there is any sign about being unfit to fly back to LJLJ. Since we knew what was the issue and also the mechanic at LJU showed me copy of document from AMM that any residual after engine cleaning is not toxic we agreed that we will continue with the operation. Also we had 1h50min on ground.
But after take off from VIE the odours were present in the cockpit again especially during climb out. After few minutes into the flight odour concentration slowly reduced but it was still present in the cockpit. In general the concentration was less obvius than during the first flight. SO again decision was done that we return the aircraft to LJU. Additionaly, the same odour appeared again during the larger thrust change. It was most obvius when thrust was reduced from climb to idle thrust setting.

Upon landing I recieved complaints from F/O about irritating feeling in the nose and CCM1 reported  headache to me. I have the same symptoms. I received no complaints from CCM2. Interestingly he didn't felt this irritation during the flight as much as we did, but after landing he stepped into the cockpit and immediately sensed it even without air condition.
Upon arrival to LJU we all agreed that medical attention was not neccessary but being precautionary I reported UNFIT condition for next day OPS.

Prevrnil se je seveda zaradi vibracij, pa tudi ker ni bil pritrjen ali kakorkoli drugače varovan. Ustrašil sem se da bo zdrsnil pod pedala in jih celo zagozdil, še bolj pa sem se ustrašil, ko sem spoznal, da bi prekinitev vzleta definitivno vodila v to smer, da bi binder zašel sigurno pod krmila. 

Letali AAU/AAV že od začetka predstavljata nevarni žarišči za incidente, ker nista opremljeni kot ostala naša letala.

Gre za 3 elemente, ki manjkajo in s tem omogočajo latentna žarišča incidentov. 

Pred časom je v naši družbi odmeval primer, ko je OFP holder padel z glareshielda in aktiviral ročico flapsov. Dogodilo se je seveda v cruisu in samo hitra reakcija posadke je preprečila katastrofo. Po tem dogodku smo določili safe/secure spots za OFP holder, glede na razne faze leta. 

Sedaj na AAU/AAV pa nimamo: 

- binder holderjev (binderji se nahajajo povsod - nevarovani). Pred leti je f100 družbe Montenegro v Ljubljani med LDG Rollom zapeljal s steze. Kapitan je kot razlog navedel, da mu je na tiller padel binder !!

- cell phone holderjev. Telefoni so po pravilu zataknjeni v luknjo od Roll Disconnect ročice. Samo čakam kdaj bo nekdo sprožil flape, ko bo frcnil telefon vstran, da bo lahko tipkal po FMS-u.

- nimamo profilčka, ki drži speed booklet pokonci. Nevarnost je v tem, da sedaj sp.booklet leži v najbolj ležečem (nižjem) položaju kar pomeni, da se ne da selektirati max thrust !!! Speed booklet je namreč predebel za režo, ki ostane ko so ročice potisnjene v položaj max thrust.

Modifikacije (manjkajoče) predstavljajo tako zanemarljiv strošek v primerjavi z enim samim incidentom, da ne razumem razlogov zakaj določeni nosilci funkcij ne ukrenejo nič. Tudi vem, da vse te modifikacije nimajo kritja Bombardierja ali STC organizacije, toda tveganje je enostavno preveliko za take finese, še posebej, če je že cela flota od začetka opremljena na tak način in to celo predstavlja naš standard (aircraft library).

Subject: Increased security at Tallinn Airport following a bomb threat

Dear colleague

The Estonian Internal Security Service received a phone call early this morning with a bomb threat issued against flights from Tallinn to Germany this week. The police authorities are verifying the authenticity of the threat and additional security measures have been activated at Tallinn Airport as a precaution. There will not be any changes in the flight schedule and the airport continues to operate normally. Additional patrolmen have been posted to ensure safety in the terminal and the baggage on flights to Germany will be checked additionally for any suspicious materials. The current aviation safety measures at Tallinn Airport are deemed to be sufficient for ensuring everyone's safety and the timely operations of the airport without disruptions to the flights schedule. 

Please do not hesitate to contact us with further questions

After the third attempt (twice the fuel spilled out of the hose connector) he managed to connect the hose properly and we could refuel normally.
At the time of the event the fuel truck operator connected the hose and none of the crew was present, nor did we intend to take fuel at that time as the pax (DHC crew), were still on board.

Upon check-out, the ID's were not kept in a safe deposit box as promised, and we actually stored behind the front desk counter top, which was accessible to anyone. 
The relevant Operations managers have already been advised. 
This is for the benefit of the Safety Team only.

2407375,SOR-0237-2019,Fatigue LRTR 04apr-8apr2019,Europe and North Atlantic - Romania / LRTR,"After return from five days of outbase (LRTR) I noticed a significant drop in my immune system. My health status is considerably worse after return and on the third day being at home now consequences are still visible - Labial herpes on the upper lip and now already fourth day in a row almost constant right eyelid spasm (never experienced before!). Both are symptoms of increased stress and fatigue.
Five 5 early starts (you could also consider it as a night duty), all of them actual wake up at 0400am local (summer) time. Let me point out, that ‘my body clock’ was still not acclimatized to one-hour winter/summer time change and additionally one hour of time zone change regarding home base. Effectively that meant I was awake at two o’clock in the morning five days in a row!? Without a normal breakfast five days in a row!? Recommendation from doctor how to eat and what to eat until the company provides me a normal living pattern is useless. And no, I didn’t go to bed at 08 pm, it was 06 pm local time every day!
On top of that two or three duties where planned to just within maximum allowed flight duty time, extension not allowed. There is a huge difference flying only two sectors or flying four sectors under the same flight time limit and not to even mention turn around times. As soon incoming pax left the plane, the outgoing pax were already in front of the plane. Every day! Not even enough time to fulfill physiological needs. 
It is extremely hard to stay within standards. A warning should be triggered and crew should receive sufficient time at home base before being sent to outbase again only after two days at home.
Not to mention all vacation requests are denied, even for just only one day in a month very important to me and my family. ONE DAY RUPTURES THE ENTIRE PLAN??!?  Family life is put under enormous stress and without at least change in roster pattern, I will have to reconsider if I can continue to fulfill the required standard.",1,20

On both departures from LJU we used de-icing and anti-icing treatment, due to cold wings and moderate rain conditions.
On second departure from LJU, during initial climb flaps failed at 0, but slats were visibly moving from 1 to 0, so they were operational. The flight controls synoptic page showed flaps 0, so we decided initially to climb out of clouds and continue towards FRA. At FRA the RWY is longer, headwind existed and I expected technical support. After consulting Operations centre and Adria Tehnika, we concluded that return to LJU is more appropriate for determining the cause and providing appropriate maintenance action (I was informed that no technical support in FRA is expected). We informed the pax and cabin crew and started our approach preparation. We completed the QRH applicable to determining approach speed, ALD and preparing the aircraft for flapless landing. We used slats as they were functioning and determined the approach speed of 166 kts and ALD which gave us ALD within 60% of LDA. Runway was wet at the time and icing conditions existed during approach. We used full reverse and moderate braking and reached normal taxi speed abeam G intersection but vacated RWY via K. Flaps fail was entered in ATL.
In my opinion moderate snow showers combined with flaps half speed during initial climb contributed to the event (our actions in flap retracting schedule were gradual in terms of one step at the time).",0,2

Day 1
 vie-ksc, aua 743
With one word ground transport from ksc airport to hotel is inappropriate.
Why:
- skoda octavia caravan is to small for four crew members with suitcase
- driver is smoking in the car
- driver is talking with dispetch while driving
- driver is driving above all speed limitations
- driver is driving the potatoes 

And the corrective action taken during be droven like potatoes:
- yes we manage to put us and suitcase in the car
- yes we communicated all the isues in friedly way
- yes we arrived to hotel without accident

But potential to became pire from potatoes is big and barriers after all day fliying are low 

So my modest opinion is that crew shoul not waste energy with that kind of thinks which should be arranged from supporting services.

But maybe I am wrong because potatoes do not talk and do not think.
The next report follows on day 2 episode.

Zadeva: Nenavaden vonj 

Spoštovani,

v petek, 14. 4., sem imela dvojno letenje na AAL. Bila sem CCM 1. S CCM 2 sva na prvem letu v sprednji kuhinji zaznali nenavaden, močan vonj po nekakšnem olju, nafti, ki se je pojavil kar naenkrat. Vsakič sem o tem obvestila kapitana kot tudi o piskanju v vratih L1. Lahko rečem, da smo na prvem letu veliko komunicirali. S CCM 2 sva natančno preiskali kuhinjo, odmikali atlas bokse, tipali, če je kje vroča stena ... Ugotovili sva, da se vonj pojavi, ko odpreva predalček s kavo. V Ljubljani smo poklicali mehanika, ki je predal odstranil, pregledal odprtino in zagotovil, da zadaj ni nobenih napeljav. Ko sem povohala vodila predala, sem ugotovila, da je to ta vonj. Mehanik mi je povedal, da imajo nekakšen sprej za mazanje vodil, imena si nisem zapomnila, in da je bil ocitno predal namazan s tem.

Glede na to, da ta vonj zaznavam že dlje, da smo že klicali mehanika, da sem o tem že večkrat obvestila kapitane, me zanima, zakaj ni povezave med delom mehanikov in našo obveščenostjo, saj bi bila kabinska posadka veliko bolj mirna ob informaciji, da so bila v sprednji kuhinji samo namazana neka vodila. Naj povem, da je vonj močan in da se razvije zelo hitro. Vsakič, ko sem delala s kakšno CCM 2, je bil pogovor v stilu: ""O že spet ta vonj."" 

Hvala za vaš čas, morala sem napisati tole poročilo, ker mi je mar tudi za druge posadke.

Lep dan želim,

Usually they park so that in an emergency they can just drive away.
Refuelling took very long time and according to FO the driver (refueller) seemed to act unusual while performing his tasks. Uplift was low just approximately 600 litres. Refueller paused a few times during the process and tried to disconnect the refuelling hose before the fuelling process was completed.
When fuelling was finished he did not fill out appropriate form for fuel receipt. He handed some other form to the FO and had problems writing .
Pax were boarded when fuelling was finished and when we were finishing with boarding fuel truck driver started to move the truck. He started to move towards the aeroplane. Ground personnel signalled him to stop. But he seemed to be unresponsive. He was signalling that he will go backwards and every time he tried to start driving he moved closer to the aeroplane.
He came close enough to touch aircraft fuselage with his LH side mirror.
One of ground workers managed to stop the truck with emergency shut down button on front right corner of the truck. Driver still restarted the engine and tried to move again.
Mirror folded backwards and contacted with the fuselage for the second time.
Contact with the fuselage was approximately 2 m in front of the wing.
Other ground worker has managed to put chocks under the front wheels of the truck to prevent further damage (first they used small size chocks and later full size used for aircrafts).
Driver seemed to be completely disoriented.
I requested police assistance via the tower freq.
Driver tried to exit the truck on driver side but door and the mirror were already to close to the fuselage so he could not open the door. He exited on the right side and there was some conversation in Slovak language between him and other ground staff. 
When police arrived he was already back in the truck. They managed to get him out of the vehicle.
I contacted Adria Tehnika mechanic to confirm no damage was caused to the airplane.
Second operator of the truck had to come from the city so delay was inevitable.
We waited for mechanic to confirm airworthiness and other driver to move the truck.

His response surprised me, because he suggested that if I do visual assessment that the damage is not dangerous that I can fly back to LJU and that is better not to sent an email with the picture of damaged engine. 
I refused, sent the email to Ljubljana and requested LH maintenance to asses whether the  damage was within the limits. He agreed to my course of action. He did not have the contact, so I requested OC to do it for me.
 Few minutes later LMLD called back and responded that from the picture, LMLD can tell, that the damage was attended and that somebody forgot to fill out the damage chart. We agreed that the damage chart should be fill out immediately after our return from MUC. We departed MUC.
After LDG in LJU, Maintenance was not waiting for us. After 20 min of waiting I contacted LMLD that somebody shall come to fill out the relevant damage chart. The response surprised me again...LMLD told me that they need to the assessment whether the damage was within the limits and that they dont have any papers or track of the damage. I refused to accept the ACFT for the subsequent flight. Made ATL entry and JL entry.
I would like to receive answers to following questions:
How come that LMLD proposed that a pilot should make assessment of particular damage which he can not do or is not authorised to do it?
How is it possible, that the status of the damage changed with each phone call?
Why wasnt maintenance proactive in their action when we returned to LJU with the knowledge/awareness that they are not fully aware whether  the damage was within the limits?

My unnecessary additional comment...I have stoped counting how many layers of cheese model were put exactly over each other...

Thank you for the answers.

The Escort brought the  baggage first. He asked me and my colleague to step away from the aisle during the boarding in order not to get hurt by the boarding DEPA. I informed my Captain about this demand.

The DEPA was seated at the back of the van. When they wanted to get him out, he started protesting loudly, he wanted to stay in, but with his hands and legs tied tightly, he had little chance. The police violently forced him out. The other DEPA still in the van, was constantly shouting obscenities very loudly.
The bus with our passengers arrived, they were all watching in horror as the Police tried to drag the tied passenger towards the airplane.
I pleaded them repeatedly to stop the violence, but to no avail.

The Captain told the Police that he is refusing the boarding of both DEPA. He calmly explained possible ways of transport for such passengers.
After some time the police van gave enough space, so our passengers could board the plane, many of them asking what is going on.

When the boarding was completed, the Police van was still waiting beside our aircraft. The Captain asked me to close the door. The door was half-way closed, when suddenly one of the Policemen started pushing the stairs down, shouting ""Stop! Stop!"". I slowly let the stairs back down again, afraid he will force them down otherwise and break something.  
The Captain asked me again to close the door, which I did. At that time the Police  van moved up front, blocking our way out.

The Captain made the announcement to the passengers, explaining the situation.

After additional Captain's intervention the Police moved and we were able to depart about half an hour after the scheduled departure time.

The air condition was above the bed and it was impossible to use it during night. Every 10 minutes the ambulance car with the siren passed the hotel, which was also the reason that the windows had to remain closed. Because of our biorhythm, it is impossible to convince the body that it must be in bed in the middle of the afternoon to reach eight hours of sleep till pick-up. So, we went to bed every night after the sunset, followed by five hours of poor sleep due to the aforementioned circumstances. Due to lack of sleep, flying was harder every day. On the fourth day, we found out that we repeatedly overheard the ATC. We all complained about fatigue and wondered if flying was still safe.

2204987,SOR-0250-2018,Fatigue due to scheduling regardless of human factor ,Europe and North Atlantic - Slovenia / PRN,"After working from 22.6 till 26.6.2018 in PRN on all morning flights to FRA and TIA with one ground transfer from Tia to PRN I felt fatigue on the 25.6 and even more on 26.6.2018. Due to the fact that in PRN no stby options are available the “unfit to fly” option due to fatigue is compromized due to the psychological pressure of grounding the airplane.

I already wrote a voluntary safety report 18.6.2018 on this issue (SR-0022-2018).

On behalf of all that I would also like to mention that I tried to get some sleep in the afternoon hours to recharge my personal energy level for the next working days. Unfortunately Emerald is building a bigger hotel (which is now taking place for almost a year) and so during the day there is a lot of construction work noise and it is impossible to sleep during the afternoon!
Also to go to sleep in the evening, lets say around 2100LT it is quite noisy because of all the weddings and conferences that take place in the hotel.

On behalf of all the facts I am looking forward that the Safety team reacts on this and organize scheduling in a more human way!

Also taxi instruction was issued on same frequency: taxi to holding point Rwy 35. While approaching holding point we were cleared for take off on the same frequency. We asked which frequency to switch to ,expecting the Tower frequency. Ground told us the Radar frequency and that we should switch after take off on his instruction. We repeated the frequency and (in accordance with our understanding) that we switch by ourselves. Ground again told us the frequency and that we switch to it when convenient.
As a result we switched frequency and started take off roll with radar frequency active while still not contacting ATC. Although we were the only aircraft moving on the airport, and we had the whole runway in sight and we were cleared for take-off, there was a risk that take off clearance would be canceled and we weouldn’t hear it because we were on different frequency.
As a by-result of confusion we forgot to read the below-the-line part of before take-off check list. 
Questions that arise: Is Ground frequency authorized to issue take-off clearance? At similar-size airports, tower frequency is always active and other frequencies (e.g. ground, apron) are active temporarily in accordance with traffic demand. It is confusing to have take-off clearance issued by ground and not tower frequency. This way of ATC operation was confusing.

On both events I took control and stowed and redeployed reversers without any problem.
In combination with weather, short runway and late touch-down tendency (also holding nose wheel in the air too long and thus waiting for reverser deployment initiation) this could pose a latent threat for runway excursion.

We expected 1 DEPU passenger and 2 DEPA passengers with two escorts. It was suspitious to me, that we did not receive any additional information about the reason for deportation or nature of committed crime or potential disruptive passengers notice.
When I was approached by policeman for the first time, he was very polite and we talked about boarding procedures and emergency related procedures briefly. I could see he was nervous while telling me, that there is now specials with DEPA pax and that police knows the procedure well. He asked if I trusted him, which I confirmed.
I could hear cursing from the police van in Serbian language and could see older man looking at the flight deck while speaking this words.
Purser turned my attention to another man being dragged towards the airplane stairs while being choked by one policemen from behind. The man could hardly breath.
During this time the passenger bus arrived and I could see how horrified they were.
I decided to stop this, steped on top of the stairs and told the Police, that I am refusing the carriage of these two passengers on board our aircraft.
Policeman who approached me before, told me that we will not leave the parking position, if we don't take these two passengers. He explained, that they are convicted criminals, who have to go to court in their home country. I told him again, that my decision is final and ordered boarding of the passengers from the bus. In a meanwhile I again explained procedures to the handling agent and asked him, why he brought the bus to the site in the first place, without coordination with Police.
As we received the documents and got ATC clearance, Police parked the van infront of the aircraft, to prevent our departure.
I ordered the purser to close the main door, but while doing so, the policeman jumped on the stairs to prevent closing. I intervened again and told them to leave the site.
At the time, they expected from me to get of the aircraft to sign some sort of document, which I refused. As Police was looking away from the aircraft, I ordered the doors to be closed. This time we surprised them and succeed.
Thereafter I informed the ATC about unlawfull interference of Police with civil aviation and requested them to coordinate their removal from higher Police authority.
We felt threatened and we were held without sane reason. As I refused boarding of DEPA passengers clearly, they had no right to oppose my final decision as Commander of this flight. The refusal was in the interest of safety of crew and other passengers as well as in a strong will of DEPA passengers against travel.

My flight plan from 30.5 – 3.6 (check the attachment)
I would like to say that, that kind of planning is very stressful and fatigue and in my opinion totally not necessary (especially because for June company gave cabin crew extra vacations - that means that we do not have lack of cabin crew).
 - No time for physical needs - no time for decent meal, except second day - we eat at airport restaurant and also third day but only because plane was late from SSJ/PRN. If you do not bring meals with you for 5 days - you are hungry.
- Then we moved from plane to plane with our suitcases all the time, performed security searches, checked EM equipment, deal with delays all the time and upset pax,.. On the last flight of the day I was really tired.
I would like to say that unfortunately I am not a robot and that kind of planning is unacceptable and stressful.

So if you want to interpret things correctly one must presume that you wake up one hour or less before pickup to address ones own needs, that be 02:05 and if you sleep for eight hours you went to bed at 18:05 and fall asleep immediately. Therefore one has 3:30 hours to get undressed go to some location to have a meal get back to hotel prepare for sleep and “punch out” at 18:05 to have eight hours of quality sleep to be fit and ready for NINE hour duty.
Well in reality none of the crew members could fall asleep “on the cue”, despite turning in early. And I changed the time of pickup for half an hour.
Hours of sleep varied from six to four hours . None got eight or close. In the morning we all felt we can do our duty, but after flight out of LJU more and more fatigue begun to surface. Simple task of arithmetic was slow and incorrect, preparation of fms was sloppy, frequencies noted incorrectly, briefings done twice just for make sure etc..
All crew members were silent and asleep on turnover reported kinking from time to time during flight. One reported headache on way to LJU. Copilot expressed concerns regarding state of aircraft, because we had problems with AP disconnecting without warning and he was becoming weary fatigued. CTOT waiting at BRU did not help with that problem as well.
We were lucky with the aircraft working and weather improving, but I am afraid to think to add those factors into account.
We were far far away from normal operational state on final leg. Our resources were bare minimum and thus far from safe normal operation.
This was my second operation of this sort in last consecutive four days. So you may count the hours of good sleep for me. After returning to home i fell asleep until evening. Yes i was very tired.
So my concern is this; After returning to LJU in the morning continuing flights are to my experience serious risk we can not afford EVER.

2539370,SR-0047-2019,Unfit on 03. 06. 2019 due to fatigue,JP394/395,"Dear fatigue management team,

I would like to explain why I’ve called in unfit for the flight JP394/395 on the 3rd of June 2019. To begin with, the way this flight plan is planed is that you finish 4 days in row after midnight which means that you arrive to the hotel  between 1am and 2am due o the delays as well and ends at 22.35 LT on the 5th day( my plan is in the attachment).
So in order to have breakfast that ends at 10am one has to get up at 9am to have some decent food for the day. So that gives you from 6 to 7 hour max of sleep per day. Definitely not sufficient after working 4 legs 3 days in row with all the delays, joint flight, unsatisfied passengers with loads of questions and complaints, changing the aircrafts, a lot of stress, ect. And you also have to bring food with you for 5 days, because there is no guarantee that you will manage to have something healthy to eat during the day.
I was completely  exhausted and fatigue after the 4th day and I could barely get out of bed on the fifth. I was the only one in my crew to have such a flight plan the rest of the crew had 2 or 3 days of this and they have all complained of being exhausted. 
I’d also like to add that there was no reason to plan like this since the company offered extra vacation days to the cabin crew so there was definitely enough resources not to make such inhuman plan. 

Kind regards

I discussed the issue with my FO and decided that FO will be PF on this sector and I will assist as a precautionary measure.

After flight I informed operations center of unfit to fly condition for last two sectors.
In retrospective in realized that working consecutive 4 sector legs in combination with short field operation and inexperienced FO took its toll.
Additionally contributing factor was inadequate nutrition opportunities on those 4 days leading into this event. Only normal meal available was breakfast and the rest is reheated meals on board.
Next contributing factor was repeated outbase roster blocks for most of my month leading into the event.

Verjamem, da po fatigue guidance še to znese ampak na dolgem duty dnevu z menjavanjem letal in tudi short turn aroundi je to zelo naporno. Temu doprinese slabo spanje v hotelih (obnova dvigal v WRO on obupno vroče sobe TSR). Ker smo se vsak dan prestavljali s kufri iz mesta v mesto to še dodatno vpliva na zbranost in spočitost. Pri meni osebno je še dodatno vplivalo, da ni bilo nobenega navodila na emailu in prvi dan bloka CAT III šolanje. Nadalnje kar zelo vpliva na zbranost je čakanje na letališču letalo, ki konstantno zamuja (crew planning), ker moraš iz hotela 1:30h pred checkin (WRO in TSR). Na koncu pa letalo tako zamuja, da v primeru 4 urnega čakanja v MUC ostaneš na letališču in spet postopaš, ker je vožnja v hotel 35 minut v eno smer.

Comparing the current circumstances and fatique level, so early into the summer season, with the same period last year, a significant increase in fatique can be seen. Everybody from the flight crew agree that current planning of ACMI operation from TSR and WRO is unacceptable. Very early check-in, at 3:40, according our ""slovenian"" body clock, inability to go to sleep at 19h, in order to get sufficient rest, no opportunity to get proper breakfast, four short sectors with too short turn-around times, just to squeeze them into daily FDP limitation, etc... Five days in a row. This not only poses a great safety risk, but will sooner or later result in increased number of sick leaves and ""unfit to fly"" reports. To avoid cronical fatique among flight crew and consequently crew shortage, a crew planning pattern shall be amended. 
My roster started with five days of TSR flights, as described above, followed by overnight stays in TIA, followed by overnight stay in SKP. Last day in SKP my body temperature went up, I lost my voice, ears became clogged, so I had to report a sick leave.

Kar nekaj PVR-ov je bilo že napisanih na to temo, pa se vendar ta praksa še kar naprej uporablja. Odgovor planske službe je bil, da se SVO let ne bo planiral s še kakšnim letom.

To smo dobili tudi od strani kontrole LJU 135.275.Na moje vprašanje, če je izpad posledica udara strele po nočnih nevihtah, sem dobil odgovor, da ne. ILS so izklopili, ker bo popoldne prišlo letalo za kalibražo, ki bo kalibiriral ILS. Ker smo že bili relativno blizu letališča sem opomnil, da kako izgleda vreme ni bil pravi čas zato. Tistih FEW na 200 je v bistvu na pragu steze in slabo kaže. Po minuti se je oglasil kontrolor in sporočil, da je pravkar govoril z METEO LJU in je meteorolog izjavil, da je baza oblakov nad letališčem na 7000ft?!!! Na to sem ponovil, da zelo slabo kaže in je vremensko poročilo neadekvatno dejanskemu stanju za letala v prihodu. Nadaljevali smo VOR app., vse do minimuma in, ker nismo nič videli smo naredili Go-around. V go-aroundu sem opazil, da se vizuelno vidi prag steze 12. V go-aroundu smo dobili po MW, radar HDG 170. Na to sem jaz prevzel kontrolo in zahteval VIS approach za RWY 12. V fazi go-arounda je kontrolor takoj začel spraševati kaj nameravamo na kar sem ga opozoril , da rabimo čas za premislek. Smo v letalu in ne v pisarni. No odločil sem se poskusiti vis. app RW12. Že ko smo se postavili v final za RWY12 sem videl, da je letališče že popolnoma prekrito z nizko oblačnostjo in da tudi ne bomo zapuščali višino šolskega kroga in smo sporočili kontroli stolpa, da delamo missapp procedure. TWR nas je ""prebacil"" na radarsko kontrolo, ki nam je sprva reklo, da gremo na VOR DOL in v holding. Na to sem ga opozoril, da imamo goriva za 5 min holdina in po tem direktno na ALT airport. Povedal je da tehnika dela na tem, da vklopi ILS in da rabijoj nekaj časa. Ponovil sem, da lahko čakam 5min in nič več. Dve minuti po tem je izjavil, da ILS dela, kar smo tudi sami videli po pozitivni ident. za ILS30 LJU. Vmes je kontrolor želel poslati Easy Jet v VOR 30 app. Reagiral sem takoj in obvestil kolegu v Easy Jetu, da smo naredili že 2 go-arounda in da je iz VOR-approacha nemogoče sletet. Easy Jet je po tem izjavil, da bo rajši počakal. Mi smo dobili radar vectoring za ILS30. Točno na minimuma za CAT I ILS RWY 30 1420' smo zagledali luči in sem lahko pristal.
1. Kako lahko izključi kontrola ILS na osnovi prognoze.
2. Kako lahko meteorolog, brez ""malo letalskega pogleda"" pride na platformo pogleda v zenit in reče;""baza je na 7000'!!"" Ve da nismo helikopter in da nas zanima kaj je v prilazu in na začetku steze, ne kaj je nad njim na sredini platofrme.
3. Zakaj kontrolor na stolpu ni opozoril, da ATIS vreme ne odgovarja dejanskemu stanju??
4.Zakaj tako formalistično obnašanje meteo službe in kontrole letenja. Oni so SERVIS!!!!

Since POD VOR is U/S (by NOTAM) we were intend to follow Tempo ILS Y procedure for ILS36! (wihch uses NDB for track navigation and PDC DME for distance)!
In FMS we noticed mistake in that procedure-and CM2=PF inserted PBD1( POD NDB track 160, 9.0 DME as depicted on Tempo ILS Y proc. RWY36). 
Pilot flying decided to follow outbound track to PBD01 in NAV mode and we had also NDB tuned!

I strictly pointed out to PF that we have to fly AP in HDG mode till 9.1 DME(QDR-160 POD NDB) and that we can descend  to 1800ft QNH for final interception of LOC and GS!
PF left AP ON and FMS guidance guided the turn at cca 7DME PDC to the right for final!
At that moment we started to be high!
Also when PF started descend(from 3500ft) to 1800ft QNH in right turn we were at half turn towards LOC36!
APPR mode was armed and LOC* guidance appear! Than PF started interception from above with V/S mode-initially with Speed Bug above ACFT speed, so that A/THR gave as additional thrust!
I CM1(PNF) helped to set Sped Bug below ACFT actual speed,so A/THR reduced THR to IDLE almost immediately! 
At that point we have seen the RWY (APT) and we decleared VISUAL DES for FINAL 36!

As we came to the airport, we got a new printout, amended flight plan, which we didn't check immediately, with minimum fuel required 4570kg. The reason for this was, that there was a prob30 tempo fog forecast in the morning for Lju and Zag. So the alternate on the new flight plan was changed to Vie. As we found this out, passangers were already boarding and we would make a significant delay with last minute refuelling. We checked present weather (which was good for dest and altn) and decided to take less fuel, than flight planned fuel (prob 30 tempo - not required to take into account for planning). The mistake I made was writing on the flight plan, that the new alternate is LIPQ (which opens only at 5 utc). Should have crossed out Vie and left Zag as alternate. We came to Lju with about 600 kg extra fuel due to ATC direct routings. Lju weather was clouds scattered at 200ft, vis more than 10 km and we saw the rwy lights  at about 350ft AGL.

1735191,SH-0008-2015,Flight Crew scheduling after last early morning flight from Tirana chain,Tirana chain end leg and home base continuation,"I am filing request for proper safety evaluation (Hazard identification and Associated risks analisys) on the subject of specific rosterings on the last day of Tirana chain. For quite some time there is an operational practice, which has not been in place in the past, to schedule the same crew, which has flown early morning flight from TIA, to continue duty on day flights to VIE, BRU or ZRH. Having in mind that this specific crew has done at least two duties in TIA which according to legislation and fatigue management principles are counted as biorhythm disruptive schedules, according my opinion and experience and also according to experience of other crewmembers, this kind of rostering represents hazard and risks should be accounted for.
My personal opinion is that continuation of duty for crew which has woken up to prepare for duty at 2.30 AM, to fly to LJU and wait hour and a half on the aircraft, then fly to VIE, wait there for another hour or so, to finally fly back to LJU represents a hazard. Why? Because the whole crew experienced fatigue which has represented as episodes of sleepiness during flights to VIE and back. It is something which can normally be expected because human organism and its biorhythm can not adapt to such changes in a short time like day or two. Nobody can expect from anyone to force him/herself to start sleeping cycle before such duty at 7PM. So we are experiencing sleep deprivation which manifests usually in most serious way during late morning hours.
So, since there is no Fatigue Management System in AA to deal systematically with associated risks while introducing such rostering change, I expext Flight Safety Unit in the company to be the one and only entity which would identify Hazards and asses associated risks following Management of Change techniques and practices mandated by the legislation. This kind of rostering would have to be processed as part of Management of Change process when introduced.
Personally I am convinced that this has not been done. But, if done, I would like to get an overview of the hazard analysis and risk assessment. Specifically, i would like to see what control measures have been taken to reduce risks to an acceptable level.
The only answer which is not acceptable would be that this rostering is in accordance with legal requirements and limitations. That is the legal frame for management, Flight Safety point of view, interest and action of course would be outside this frame.
Of course, anyone of the crew can always report ""unfit to fly"" condition at the time of arrival from first leg, this might reduce risks on the personal level, but I think safety management system standards require company to approach and manage  such hazards and risks systematically, on the operator level.

Thank you.

We then noticce ramp agent and AATehnika mechanic, that they entered the area very very cautiously as they already knew of the problem. Commander refused to start boarding until the problem is solved. Although passengers come in dry shoes, they have to pass the wet, very slippery and tilted surface.
Airport staff attempted to help but they have no mat/doormat to use. They decided to clean the surface with cleaning agent and water. On request of the flight crew, ground staff from the gate (with clean and dry shoes) tested the surface, but it was found to be very slippery. Airport staff attempted to mop the floor as dry as possible.
To prevent passenger injury (passengers with cabin bags, mothers with children and infants), we delayed boarding until area was dry. 15 minutes delay.
According to information gathered later, the problem is happening again and again. According to my opinion, area below the staff entry is bound to become wet (direct access from apron) and should therefore be paved with appropriate anti-slip flooring. Yellow warning signs are inappropriate; floor is tilted and therefore not comparable with regular mopped areas. If nothing is done, somebody is bound to get injured.",1,20

GOSTI 2D departure was flown but discussed with tower that right turn toward SKJ visually could be flown. After TO we had increased speed 180 kts to counter possible shears. The terrain clearance was assured but ROC was not stable in a speed mode so we changed to vertical speed to gain speed as we remained on flaps during turn to assure sufficient lift since wind velocity was high and the rain caught up with us. We turned right to avoid it but storm was surprisingly  fast and we stayed in rain throughout the turn. I engaged speed mode again but could not control the speed so i reengage VS and try to over came ROC which was very high and pitch was increasing so at one point we had enough and took manual control of aircraft and regain normal speed and pitch cleaned the flaps and continued on avoiding heading. 
 In short weather was not severe, rain and higher winds only , distraction was rain but not to much. FD was unable to cope with the wind and speed  demands and flight profile could become compromised at some point if we would not react with manual input. To us we experienced very sluggish reaction of FD autopilot to our demands, taking into consideration higher speed and flaps lowered, TOW 32,9 t, and autopilot over reacted on those inputs.

On the mentioned flight there was a strong northerly wind situation at LJU (as I remember also WS was reported in ATIS).
The approach was turbulent with speed fluctuations but nothing too serious. Speed was maintained in positive manner since WX and RWY condition was otherwise OK.
During flare I started to retard throttles towards idle at/or little below 50ft RA very gradually and there was nothing unusual till 20-30ft RA when AC started to sink rapidly towards ground (felt like a small negative WS pushed the AC down).
There was no stall warning or stick shaker and as I remember even a continuous ignition never came on. I would describe the landing itself as a positive landing but sure didn’t feel like a hard landing.(not something I would experience on CRJ200 frequently but might be more often on CRJ900). Since there was no bounce or any warning or caution triggered no report was filled.

I can say that I experienced light dizziness,light burning throat and eyes, which ends approx. 10 minutes after passing FL150, when fumes disappeared. For me this was first time to experienced TCP in such extension. We check aircraft technical log and found out, that there were a few entries from previous captains, who noticed TCP fumes and also left writing findings. We also noticed that on Left Engine there were oil  filling (2 units) on approx. every 19 to 20 flight hours. From 2.11. till today there were 4 (2 units) fillings. In the same time on Right Engine only one (1.25 unit)???!!!  Entries from captains, which already experienced fumes, were every time approx. 3 to 5 hours after oil fillings. In my opinion this motor has to be put out of operation until correct maintenance repair.  It's evident that Maintenance didn't eliminate main cause yet.
It's obvious that cleaning of air condition ducting, is not effective, but it's a good way to put aircraft in operation with notice, that there might be some fumes because of that. But there is a huge difference between those fumes and TCP fumes.

ESS BUS changed to green, but the three other indications remained magenta. Line remained empty and not green.
Messages began to dissapear. STAB CH1 was reset manually.
Crew consulted FCOM for possible additional info and explanation in regard to magneta ""invalid data"", but none found.
After that, it was decided by crew that GEN1 will be switched off. After switching it off, line from APU GEN  to BUS1 and ESS BUS filled with green; BUS 1 and IDG changed to green. GEN 1 turned amber and parameters were showing zeros. GEN1 message appeared. Status was reviewed, as the GEN 1 the only inoperative component/system on the airplane. Two generators were actively suplying the airplane. Since at top of descent, status was judged satisfactory and crew decided not to action GEN 1 QRH since generator was switched off intentionally.
After landing, at stand with parking brake on and engines still running, to verify technical status of the airplane, GEN 1 was switched on. Nothing happened, generator remained offline and generator was amber, parameters remained zero. GEN 1 U/S.",0,1

Razvejanost operacij (baza Ljubljana, baza Lodz) in želja po racionalizaciji poslovanja, kažeta svoje učinke na stagniranju Company Safety Policy (opredeljena v MSM 2.1.1.1). Spodaj naštete pomankljivosti, nedoslednosti, napake...so rezultat kadrovske podhranjenosti.

V kazalu priročnika ni omenjeno, da na koncu obstajajo dodatki(APPENDIX 1,2 in 3) in dvomim, da je JACL (kot organ, ki odobri priročnik) z dodatki seznanjen.

Operacija v bazi Lodz

Posledica SAFA insp. LCJ (glej PVR 1982) je bila, da je v obdobju med 14.sept.2015 in 10.nov2015 je prišlo v Operativnih specifikacijah AOC do spremembe in sicer je JACL odvzela navigacijsko specifikacijo RNP1. V skladu z OM-C(AA uporablja LIDO rutni priročnik), je le ta potrebna za vse SID in STAR na letališču Lodz (EPLL), kjer AA redno leti. V tem obdobju je bila omenjena operacija nelegalna. 
Na problem sem opozoril (v septembru) Flight Operations Manager-ja, vendar ni izdal obvestila, ki bi pilote opozorila na nelegalnost in urgentno rešil težavo. Težavo je rešila JACL, ki je v operativnih specifikacijah, z dne 10.nov.2015 AA vrnila RNP1 (razen za letalo S5-AAG). 
V zgoraj omenjenem obdobju smo spremenili 
OM-A 8.3.2.10.1 Operational Approval (Rev 33), da je bil skladen s takrat veljavnimi operativnimi določbani, vendar smo ga pozabili posodobiti nazaj (lahko bi ga z rev.34). Tako, če pilot v tem trenutku pogleda OM-A 8.3.2.10.1 in ne tudi AOC operativne določbe, še vedno pride do informacije, da nimamo RNP1.
Druga pripomba se je nanašala na rubriko PBN v najavi ICAO Flight plana in sicer, da ne najavljamo RNP-ja. Za letalo S5-AAZ, ki je veliko stacionirano v LCJ najavimo v rubriki PBN:
A1....RNP10
B2....RNAV5 GNSS
B3....RNAV5 DME/DME
B4....RNAV5 VOR/DME
B5....RNAV5 INS or IRS
C1....RNAV2 all perm. sensors
D1....RNAV1 all perm. sensors
To pomeni, da ne najavimo O1(RNP1), kot to storimo v primeru CRJ 900.

Težava je v posodabljanju priročnikov, predvsem(LIDO RM), kjer so revizije tedenske.

After DHC LJU-VIE-BTS (cca 4 hours after check-in) we boarded the plane. From the ground staff we received printouts of PPS. Since OFP prints were inferior to the one received and already signed at check-in, the OFP received at check-in was used for FMS programming. After take-off we requested for next point en-route since SID at BTS was not well suited for route. We received direct-to clearance for the poin not in our FMS. After clarification with ATC we realized that flight plans do not match and we checked the OFP that we received from the ground staf at BTS. Consequently FMS was reprogramed and flight was uneventfull.

In addition, on the next flight the situation repeated (different route) in thje time span of 2 hours and it was found out, that one OFP has FI +18, the other FI -14, which is quite intriguing.

To prevent situations like this two steps are suggested:
- When the OFP is changed on a short period after check-in, the crew shall-must be informed, that there is a new changed OFP.
- The crew shall allways check and compare OFPs received from different sources. This step does in no way exclude the first step.",0,1

Ko sem prisel v operativni center na check - in sem izvedel, da bom moral narediti še revizijo Lido kart. Dodatno pokasnilo k mojemu vprašanju glede revizije - saj jo je malo. Prvi dan bi morali leteti:
Lju - Muc DHC,
Muc - Str
Str - Muc
Muc - Wro
Čas leta iz Muc v Str in nazaj 25 minut, brez ATC short cut-ov.
Čas leta iz Muc v Wro pa 50 min.
In potem se je začelo,...
Zaradi možnega bird strike-a je posadka naredila Rejected take -off. Ker so se zavore pregrele je stopila v akcijo tudi tehnika. Posledično smo v Muc prispeli s 3 urno zamudo. Leta Muc - Str - Muc je odletela druga posadka. Mi pa samo let Muc - Wro. Za nameček je potnik na letu Lju - Muc po nesreči vzel purserjev kovček, kar nam je predstavljalo še dodatni problem, v času pisanja tega OR, je purserjev kovček še vedno v Muc na Lost and found šalterju. Zaradi vseh zamud in dodatnega stresa, ki so ga le te povzročile sem se odločil da med kratkim nočnim letom Muc - Wro, ne narediva Lido revizije.
Glede na to, da je ACMI operacija zelo stresna, še posebno če potuješ kot DHC posadka na izhodiščno točko vidim edino rešitev za Lido revizije, v popolni implementaciji EFB. In delanju Lido revizij z USB ključkom.

Solata ovela, brez polivke, piščanec na pol pečen, govedina kuhana z neprepoznano omako, zjutraj jajca ali omlete narejene prejšnji večer, vse močno preslano. Tole se vleče že predolgo. Sam sem bil že dvakrat v mestu v cateringu. Dogovoril sem se za hrano kakšna naj bi bila Obljubili so mi, da bodo uredili, pišem PVR-je, vse je brez učinka. Taka prehrana resno ogroža zdravje posadk in predstavlja resno nevarnost za varnost letenja. Zahtevam, tudi s PVR-ji, da se zamenja dobavitelja hrane na letalo.
Opozoril bi vas še na Hotel Nartel v Prištini. V začetku, ko smo se preselili v Hotel Nartel smo dobivali normalne sobe, v sredini s ""king size"" posteljo z mizo in prostorom z odlaganje prtljage. Postopoma so nam začeli dajati vse slabše sobe, manjše, z majhno posteljo, mizico na katero komaj položiš prenosnik, brez prostora za odložitev prtljage, sobe s v glavnem vogalne, ki se jih pozimi ne da pogreti, poleti pa ne shladiti. Na naše prigovarjanje je odgovor receptorjev, da nimajo drugih sob ali pa, da  je Adria naročila enoposteljne sobe. Blazine na posteljah so take, da ko se vležeš nastane luknja v njej, ali pa trde kot dila. V glavnem se večina posadk pritožuje, da se ne more naspati. Predlagam, da zamenjamo hotel.",1,50

1727200,SH-0006-2015,SLIDES , ,"While studying OM DAT I've noticed, that there's a possible safety hazard/risk involved with closing door 1L and 2L after boarding or to be more precise, arming slides.
OM doesn't mention anything about checking outside conditions first, which means, that's allowed to arm slides even when the bridge or the stairs  are still connected to the aircraft.
This is, by my opinion,  safety risk, because in the event of sudden emergency ( like fire on board etc.), CCM in distress may open the door without disarming slide. Which of course would end in blocked exit. 
Would you be so kind to reconsider this procedure again?
In our company, our procedures include checking outside conditions first (meaning, that the bridge is at least 2m away from the aircraft), which ensures us to deploy slide properly  in case of emergency.

1739232,CAA MOR-0062-2015,DAT/DOT operation,Unknown / Unknown / JP235,"Sledeče poročilo se nanaša na mojo nedavno izkušnjo z letenjem s posadko DAT/DOT. Pred nekaj dnevi sva  dve CCM2 (adrijski) opravljali šolanje za pridobitev licence za samostojno letenje na letalu A320 družbe DAT/DOT. Šlo je za letenje z nočitvijo v Innsbrucku. Že pred samim pričetkom letenja sva se s kolegico čudili njihovi praksi določanja CCM1. Glede na to, da nobena od naju ni izšolana za CCM1, je DAT/DOT inštruktorica v briefing room-u svojo (litvansko) posadko povrapšala o tem, kdo bi želel delati na poziciji CCM1. Javil se je njihov stevard in pripomnil, da ni vajen delati na tej poziciji. Moram priznati, da naju je s kolegico omenjeni dogodek kar malce presunil. Nadalje moram omeniti tudi to, da nas je na letenju spremljal mehanik Adrie tehnike, ki je nama s kolegico zaupal, da je letalo pravzaprav v zelo slabem stanju (kar se tiče vzdrzevanja). Tudi ta informaicja naju ni pustila ravnodušnih. Delo in najino šolanje prvi dan je potem potekalo skoraj brez posebnosti. Tu lahko omenim le dejstvo, da sva s kolegico celoten servis opravili skoraj sami (branje objav, strežba hrane(pijače, prodaja alkohola, komunikacija s potniki, prodaja Travel value...) Na enem izmed letov ta dan sem tudi opravila linecheck, medtem, ko se je kolegica šolala še naslednji dan. Prvi dan smo tako z delom zaključili v Innsbrucku in se odpravili v hotel. 
Naslednji dan smo se nato zgodaj zjutraj s skoraj polnim letalom (cca. 173 potnikov) iz Innsbrucka odpravili proti Ljubljani. Med boardingom pa se je zgodil dogodek, ki je pravzaprav glavni razlog za tole pisanje. DAT/DOT instruktorica je namreč po končanem boardingu k meni pripeljala starejšo gospo, ki se je zaradi slabega počutja želela izkrcati. Glede na to, da sem edina od vseh CCM govorila nemško, sem gospo povprašala o njenih razlogih in vidno zmedena mi je povedala, da ima probleme s srcem in da se boji letenja ter da se želi izkrcati. Gospo smo nato predali ramp agentu, ki jo je pospremil nazaj v letališko zgradbo. Tu moram omeniti, da je imela gospa ob izkrcanju pri sebi le manjšo torbico. Ramp agent je po tem dogodku odšel v kokpit, kjer se je pogovoril s kapitanom. Agent je po pogovoru nato zapustil letalo in mi povedal, da lahko zaprem vrata.Začuedno sem ga vprašala, če ne bomo iztovorili prtljage gospe, ki je letalo zapustila. Agent mi je odvrnil, da bo ta prtljaga odšla z nami v Ljubljano.  Precej začudena sem nato zaprla vrata letala. O zadevi s kapitanom nisem govorila, saj za to ni bilo časa. Precej očitno je bilo, da želi kapitan čimprej poleteti. Sklepam torej, da smo na omenjenem letu poleteli proti Ljubljani skupaj s prtljago potnice, ki je na letalu ni bilo. To moje sklepanje pa izhaja predvsem iz besed ramp agenta in iz samega preteka časa od izkrcanja potnice do zapiranja vrat letala (le nekaj minut). K pisanju tega poročila me je spodbudil izkušen adrijski kapitan, ki je zagotovil, da je šlo v opisanem primeru za nedopustno ravnanje DAT/DOT kapitana. Namen mojega poročila je predvsem opozoriti na odstopanja pri delu družbe DAT/DOT in posledično pripomoči k večji varnosti na letalih Adrie Airways. ",1,50

In meantime as there was short turn round we agreed to board and refuell at the same time. Fire truck was called in as it is normal in HRG. We also started boarding. At arround 6200l fuell they noticed leak from same handle again and stoped refuelling. Boarding was finished at that time. They tried 4 hose but it was worse and decided to use previous one. They put small bucket below the handle and said it is ok, and countioned fuelling. At the end I would guess there was less then 1 liter of fuell in the bucket as we finished refuelling. We got load sheet and then they wanted my signature that it was our foult for “fuell spillage”. I argued that the leak was always from the hose, the small handle as mentioned above and we argued about it. As we were already running late I added the hose, not the aircraft was leaking and signed the document.",0,4

I have  informed the Captain about the incident and after analisys of the event and impact on my personal psychological state, we have decided, that we can continue last flight operation of that day to home base.

Incident has to be investigated, to establish actual personal responsibility of sending such disturbing message   to one of the flight crew during his flight duty and intention of the sender:

Naša višina v tem trenutku je znašala FL130. Glede na podatke o vetru pri tleh 350/15 in trenutnem vetru na tej višini, hrbtni veter do 15 kts, sem se odločil, da ponudbo KL sprejmem. Do razdalje 19 Nm PRT smo v nadaljevanju leta leteli na ALT 11.000 na omenjenem radilau. V tem trenutku je znašal trenutni veter 170/25, konfuguracija leta flap 20, hitrost 200 kts, anti acing ON kolesa izvlečena in zaklenjena. Na razdalji 15 NM v konfiguraciji F 30 in hitrosti 170 kts, sem dejal kolegu, letečemu pilotu, da se prilet ne bo izšel zaradi nestabiliziranega prileta do točke FAF na 10 Nm in dejal, da prekineva prilet. Komandiral sem , da narediva zavoj v desno na višini 6000 ft. Moja komanda za izvedbo neuspelega prileta ni bila izrečena po SOP, izjavil sem le go-arround, brez besede flap 8, sočasno pa dejal, da na omenjeni višini izvedeva zavoj v desno za 360 za novi prilet. V tem času sva izvedela prehod v hor. let šele  na višini 5500 ft, pospravila konfiguracijo ter uvlekla podvozje.  Manever sem kot tak navedel tudi KL, ki je potrditev sporočila komentirala kot ""roger"". Pri izvedbi tega manevra sva s kolegom ugotovila, da naju ta manever tudi zaradi vetra ne bo pripeljal varno na začrtano pot za ponovni prilet, tako da sem v vzhodnem sektorju letališča zahteval višjo višino ter nove vektorje za prilet na 17 NM. Sprva sva dobila navodila za vzpenjanje na višino 7600 ft, glede na po moji oceni med drugim tudi izredno zbegano delo KL, sem zahteval vzpenjanje na višino 9000 ft in daljše vektorje za ponovni prilet. KL naju je vektorilrala za VOR DME S 35 prilet. Mojo odločitev zakaj sem se odločil za nestandardi neuspeli prilet izhaja iz sledečega. Ko smo leteli na višini ALT 11000 ft, nama je KL ponudila možnost zavoja v fazi prileta desno za 360 v kolikor ne bova uspela ujeti začrtanega vertikalnega profila leta. V trenutku odločitve za neuspeli prilet, sem tako posegel po tem manevru, sicer zavedajoč, da smo sedaj že nižje in da bo trenutna višina zadoščala za najin manever in priključitev na R 165 inbound za ponovni prilet. Vsa odstopanja od standardnih postopkov, ki so se v tem priletu vsekakor pojavljala in so bila tudi s strani KL ponujena, so neutemeljena in so v samem letu le povečevala stres in obremenitev posadke. Izhajajoč iz tega dejstva sem tudi v poročillu navedel prispevek KL k izvedbi leta kot takšnega. Seveda je odgovornost in končna odločitev med ponujenim možnostmi moja. ",0,10

Ptičica senička mi je prišepnila, da je problem v SLATIH, ki se izjemno počasi uvlačijo.

Težavo vidim v long flare pristankih. Po pristanku je potrebno letalo pripraviti na ponoven vzlet. Se pravi konfiguracija Flaps 20° in Slats 20°, ponovno nastaviti TRIM, povečati THRUST na TO/GA (da se Spoilerji uvlečejo). Ko pripravimo letalo na ponoven 
vzlet lahko steza postane zelo kratka. Kar onenogoči možnost Rejected Take off-a.

Če povečamo THRUST na TO/GA in letalo ni v T/O configuraciji se lahko oglasijo naslednji Warningi:
- CONFIG FLAPS
- CONFIG SPLRS
- CONFIG STAB

Kar bi še dodatno povečalo že tako velik work load.   

Druga težava, ki jo vidim pa so Hard landing-i, ki bi se potencialno zgodili, če se hočemo izogniti long flare landingom.
Če odvzamemo THRUST previsoko pristanemo v začetku TDZ, vendar pa tvegamo HARD LANDING.

Menim, da bi bilo dobro, da razdelamo vse možnosti, ki bi se nam lahko zgodile na BASE TRAININGU in jih vključimo v nek BASE TRAINING briefing.

- Long flare

- Poškodba je bila odkrita s strani pilota letala pred odhodom za Frankfurt dne 25.02.2017. Predviden odhod ob cca. 17.55.

- Pridobile so se fotografije transportnega traku, ki je bil uporabljen za razkladanje prtljage (v prilogi). Iz posnetkov je razvidno, da je transportni trak ustrezno zaščiten za preprečitev poškodb na letalu. 
- Lokacijo in čas nastanka poškodbe ni mogoče natančno določiti. Skoraj zagotovo pa se je ta zgodila pred prihodom letala iz Tirane.

1900445,CAA MOR-0091-2016,Cabin crew medical incident,UUEE,"Na letu je potekal Line Training (CCM xy delovna pozicija CCM2 / sedež CCM2)

Tik pred pristankom letala v SVO (nekaj trenutkov po Gear Down/Prepare for Landing) mi je CCM xy sporočila (interphone), da se počuti zelo slabo.
CCM ZX sem poslal k zadnjim izhodom / pozicijam CCM, da imamo operativnega CCM pri zadnjih izhodih in pogleda, kako je s sodelavko. ZX je uspelo  priti do zadnjih pozicij in ji je še pred pristankom uspelo sporočiti, da se XY še zmeraj počuti slabo in njeno stanje zgleda zaskrbljujoče.

Pristanek je bil normalen, dokaj hitro je potekalo tudi izkrcanje potnikov. Stanje sodelavke XY se ni izboljšalo pač pa se je celo na izgled poslabševalo.
Poskušali smo s tekočino, bila je zelo bleda, vrtoglavica, vstati ni mogla. Zahtevali smo zdravniško pomoč na letalu. Poskušali smo izmeriti vsaj krvni tlak (po mojem je zelo nihal, enkrat nam ga je le uspelo izmeriti - nenavadno povišan 135/105 mmHg, pulz rahlo povišan). XY se je počutila zelo slabo, delno ni zaznavala, kje se trenutno nahaja (rahla dez-orientacija). Poskušali smo jo namestiti v ležeči položaj, vendar se skoraj ni mogla premakniti oz. vstati, še najbolje se je počutila v sedečem položaju.

Zdravniška ekipa je prispela v relativno kratkem času, posredovali smo jim informacije, prav tako so imeli težavo z izmero krvnega tlaka, za popiti je dobila neko tekočino (po vonju bi rekel, da je bil nek cocktail sladkorja/mineralov/elektrolitov). Kolikor smo lahko ugotavljali/videli, je imela tudi zdr. ekipa težave z ugotavljanjem vzrokov in diagnozo stanja (oz. nam niso želeli povedati). Predlagali so prevoz v bolnišnico oz. potem na medicinsko postajo na letališču. Posadka letala je želela, da XY spremlja na postajo tudi 1 član posadke, vendar letališke odgovorne osebe (verjetno policija/mejna policija) tega ni dovolila - v tem času je prispel tudi naš predstavnik in jo je on lahko spremljal.

Po pregledu na med. postaji, je zdravnik potrdil, da XY lahko potuje z nami v LJU (ležeč položaj in počiva - imeli smo prosto zadnjo vrsto).

Glede na zmanjšano število operativnih CCM v posadki, smo let SVO-LJU opravili ob zmanjšanem številu potnikov (95), operativna CCM sva bila ZZ (CCM1) in ZX (CCM2).
XY se je proti koncu počutila nekoliko bolje (mogoče je dobila v SVO še kakšno terapijo/zdravilo), vendar še zmeraj bleda in ni v celoti zaznavala okolice in stanja. Stanje se je po pristanku v LJU še malo izboljšalo, slišala se je z domačimi, domov jo je odpeljala ZX (stanuje v bližini). Seveda smo jo napotili k zdravniku (urgenca / osebni). 

Upam, da bodo ugotovili vzroke/diagnozo težav in se bo vse uredilo. Velika pohvala in zahvala sodelavki ZX kakor tudi pilotom (capt. MM in cop. NN) ter našemu predstavniku v SVO.",0,1

There was a wedding party at ""Collection"" restaurant, next to the hotel. The music was much too loud to be able to evade it. Ear plugs or changing the room had no effect (all tried). Scheduled pick was at 5:00 (Frankfurt).
Pilots are supposed to have ""suitable accomodation"", rooms with noise insulation and silence, to be able to rest. The other problem of the hotel rooms are the too soft beds, which cause pain in the backbone. We were completely destroyed the next morning, as other crew members also had problems sleeping. 
When somebody tries to negotiate the reduction of noise from the hotel corridors, the restaurant speakers or from the fitness with the receptionist, their response is always slow. The music rarely goes out before 23h!! the fitness is open until 23h! If you are lucky enough, you can get a room directly above the fitness, where you can listen to people's legs hitting the treadmills...
 
The influence of these occurences to safety of next morning flights is significant. I suggest taking into consideration the negotiation about reduction of noise with the hotel manager or the change of our Pristina hotel.

SOR-0087-2017 written on the 2017-04-08. I fully support this statement.


FATIGUE MANAGEMENT 

The last planned roster resulted in quite disruptive schedule (five duty days).
First three days were early check-in (0440z, 0440z and 0405z) but due to implementation of summer time that was effectively additional one hour earlier( still acclimatised to winter time). On day3 i woke up without problem (even without the alarm) and on day4 as well (check-in 0645z). On all these days i went to bed latest at 2100local time.

I want to say that i was already adopted to that early schedule even on day5, but with afternoon and evening flights (4legs). After all the accumulated duty during first four days, on the last day i was working troughout the period i was already resting on previous days. That lead to extended wakefulness on last duty day and resulted in unneccessery tiredness during evening flights. Which were additionaly demanding. In my opinion this leads to only incident report. 

On day5 the last flight to Prague was combined with Warsaw (AOG), therefore we've got an extra sector and new reduced maximum FDP with possibility to encroach allowed extension. We got that information just after boarding the aircraft and app. 30 min before the new planned departure. Which was already late. 
The Commander consulted all crew members on their alertness levels before deciding the modifications of actual flight duty. We eventually agreed with modification (additional call to OPS) and departed with quite a lot of delay to Prague. 
Please check Om-a 7.4.7:
The exercise of Commander's discretion should be considered exceptional and should be avoided at home base and/or company other bases where standby or reserve crew members are available. 

Anyway, the flight was uneventfull and the next flight from Prague to Warsaw as well (except one pax made a lot of complains with flight from PRG to LJU via WAW and almost left the aircraft at Prague). 
At Warsaw ground handling was also very helpfull with pax separation after landing (refueling with pax onboard not allowed). After receiving the flight documents we entered the weight figures and prepared for engine start. 
Immediately after leaving the stand captain complained about heavy aircraft. I can also remember, that our predicted weight on speedbooklet was set on 36tons and after the loadsheet data insertion it fell down to 34tons. During taxiing to holding position captain requested that i should check the loadsheet by myself. I figured out that it was calculated with weight of 42 child pax. Captain stopped the aircraft and ccm confirmed we have only three!!! We returned back to gate and new loadsheet with correct pax was prepared. Actual weight difference cca 1600kg!

Flight to LJU uneventfull but with great dissapointment, since 20 mins before our arrival both connecting flights for our pax departed.

Rostering practices. I also noticed that my last four blocks all end with evening flights and 'spoil' my recurrent extended recovery rest periods. I recomend to improve rostering practise and to avoid the sequence of early starts and possible 'late finish' on the last day. Especcialy after five days duty.

We started speed reduction from Mach 7.4(IAS235) towards .64 and requested descend. During descend we deployed spoilers and reduced the speed towards 220 kts at FL230. We decided to lower the gear as the system  continued to recycle the nose door.

In years we have developed active communication with our customers with main goal to improve safety and support our customers operations as much as possible.

Therefore I turn to you now with request related to the flights with very similar callsigns that are operating at close time window and airspaces. Here you can read information of one problematic situation (from our Safety Team) that we would like to prevent in future: 
…/
Our ATS Department would like to let you know that our air traffic controllers encountered some problems with Adria flights (operator Nordic Aviation Group) on 23.11.2015. Tallinn ACC had two Adria flights on its frequency (with very similar flight numbers - 7123 and 7143). When transferring ADR7123 to Tampere no attention was paid to the fact that it was ADR7143  that had left Tallinn frequency (Tampere did not notice it either, that wrong flight had contacted them). When Tampere cleared direct (short) route to the flight, it turned out that the cleared point was outside the flight planned route and the destination of the flight in radio contact was Copenhagen (whereas ADR7123 was flying to Stockholm). Tampere instructed the pilot to contact Tallinn, after which the pilot reported that they had been instructed to contact Malmö (an ACC unit in Sweden).  ADR7143 was a conflicting traffic in Tallinn ACC, the controller called the pilot on the frequency several times. A bit later the controller made another attempt to reach ADR7143 in order to transfer it to Malmö, but there was no reply.
1.	We kindly invite the operator to change the callsigns and add a letter or similar to the end of the flight number combination that would provide better differentiation.
2.	Kindly check from ADR7123 pilot why the crew did not advise overflying the state border that they were entering a different airspace. 
3.	Kindly check from ADR7143 pilot why the crew refused  to come back to Tallinn frequency and contacted Malmö frequency without authorisation.
4.	A geographical error has taken place as well. Tampere is not a Swedish unit.

ETSI/IGS airport information available during preflight preparation was inconsistent, partially contradicting and to my humble opinion, impossible to interpret properly.

1.	Absolutely all minima for ETSI/IGS in Lido route manual are subject to note “HJ only” (Daytime only).
2.	The minima applicable to our particular landing (ILS or LOC Z 25L) had to be extracted from a dislocated depiction within chart notams that were dully attached to the flight prep documentation. It was not immediately clear whether the “HJ only” note is applicable also to this dislocated minima depiction.
3.	Colors of the graphical interpretation of the 25L ALS in Lido are not as I recall them during landing at ETSI/IGS and are also not matching the German military AIP ALS description.
4.	OM-C does not classify IGS airport as day only
5.	Reference to a second, though credible IAP source (Jeppesen) did not identify the ETSI/IGS ILS 25L minima as daytime only (see attachment).
6.	Reference to the AIP for IGS did not identify the airport as daytime only (see attachment).
7.	The flight has been planned from the very beginning to be executed out of daylight and thus night landing has not been imposed by an unforeseen event e.g. delay.

Vendar to ne deluje. Razlogi so različni:
-revizije se dostavijo mehaniku, vendar se ""posrednik"" in mehanik težko uskladita za predajo,
-""posrednik"" bi opravil revizijo, pa letala takrat ni v LCJ,
-...  .
Med 7. in 9. februarjem sta manjkali dve reviziji v LIDO priročniku (1604-28.jan in 1605-4.feb) in zadnja sprememba v OM-A (05.feb.). Revizija LIDO 1604 je vsebovala spremembe za letališče AMS ( z datumom veljavnosti 04.feb.), katerega se leti z LCJ.
V omenjenem obdobju so bili priročniki revidirani ob zadnjem postanku letala (S5AAZ) v LJU (npr. LIDO 1603-21.jan. in OM-A).
Mislim, da se ""posrednik"" ne zaveda pomembnosti in pravočasnosti opravila, za izvajanje varne in točne letalske operacije. Samo ekonomski motiv (posrednika)ni dovolj, mislim, da je tu potrebno še tisto, kar naš OM-A pojmuje kot ""airmanship"" in predlagam:
-da se kolege, ki so stacionirani v bazi LCJ prosi,če bi oni prevzeli to opravilo. Z enim od njih sem se pogovarjal o tem in bi bil voljan. Seveda to ne bi bilo prepuščeno dobri volji ampak bi se sklenilo dopolnilo k obstoječi pogodbi.

1774395,SH-0001-2016,ATC nit giving accurate information,IST ADR652,"The weather conditions on IST airport were forecasted to be wery bad (heavy snow with CB and strong winds). Upon our arrivle the forcast was confirmed to be true. 
The problem started when we have approaching IST airport and IST arr ATIS was U/S. We could observed the thunder lightning through our windscreen and CB formations on our weather radar. We could allso seen the snow on the ground and big and heavy snowing through our windscreen. We needed the information about the weather conditions on the airport but we failed to get them through the ATIS. We listen the dep ATIS whic gave the weather conditions for RWY 05, but not for RWY 35L which was the LDG RWY.
We were most conserned about the wind and the state of the RWY (type of contamination, depth, BA or FC..). I was very suprised that: 1. No other arr aircraft was asking for the actual conditions of the RWY 35L
2.That dep ATIS was giving  (RWY 05) BA GOOD and state of the RWY WET.
We were very suspiciousabout about the  accuracy of stated RWY conditions so we requested from ATC that we request wind and RWY conditions for RWY 35L.
This was requested as soon as we were transfered to IST ARR ATC. It took the ATC approx 10 minutes to give us the requested information. I got the feeling that ATC didnt understud the importance to informs the pilots about the the conditions on the RWY were adverse. When we finaly got the information that we requesed, the BA stated from ATC was that it is GOOD and that the RWY is covered with snow. I used COMM 2 to get RWY condition from delivery ATC and he said that the RWY is WET. So the informations we got were confused. We landed on RWY 35L which was covered with snow and BA was  far from GOOD. It was more MEDIUM to POOR.
Upon LDG the conditions on the airport were in one word chaotic. It took us 1h and 10 minutes to reach our parking position.

At time of our departure the snow was falling  alternately from light snow to heavy snow and because the only antiice fluide available was TYPE2 we requested from the handling agent to arrange 100% TYPE 2 antiicing, but he said that antiicing is only done with 50% TYPE 2 fluid. I requesed two times from him to   arrange 100% TYPE2  treatment, but he said that they told him this is not possible (The handling agent was wery cooperative and tryed his best to help and I dont blame him for that, because he only gave me the information he got from person hwo is responsible for deicing process). The problem was that if at the time of our departure there were heavy snow the 50% of TYPE2 fluid would give us only 5 minutes of holdover time, and this would not be enaught plus that it took us approx 1 hour from pushback to deice position.
Fortunatly the anticing at the end was done with 100% TYPE 2 fluid. I dont know if our insisting had anything to do with that.
We got the departure clearance for RWY 05 and because the wind was from 010 degrees 24 kts,we requested RWY 35R for departure. The request was denied. We asked again for conditions on RWY05 and we got always the same answer that BA is GOOD. But due to more favorite wind we requested RWY 35R more than once and always we got the same answer that this is not possible.  We decided to take RWY05 because that was the only option and because we got the info that BA is GOOD and we were within limits regarding the croswind. During T/O run at approx 80 kts I as a PF had a lot of dificulty maintaining the airplane  on the RWY. Airplane started to slide from centerline and it took me a lot of efort to stay on the RWY.  Abort was not the option because we would put our self in even more dangerous situation. 
The ATC with their inaccurate informations put us in a wery dangerous situation which could end as airplane slippe from the RWY.

We did so clearly and comprehensively in an independent, professional and understanding yet firm manner.

This, without any direct reason, apparently upset the handling agent to the extent where she decided to retaliate by withdrawing, without any legal grounds, all documentation for our subsequent flight. Further not showing up for a timely dispatch, and not transferring her duties to another agent even after our clear intervention, must have meant, she was intentionally unlawfully interfering with the flight. Her intentional neglect of passing on the information to the crew regarding DAA luggage was a direct threat to the safety of the flight.  

Three things I want to stress at the end of this report:

1.	Her virtually taking hostage 44 passengers, a 30 million jet and its crew for a whole hour by childishly hiding somewhere in the terminal is an unprecedented event that neither the purser during her 25 years of service nor I during my 20 year career, have ever encountered. Not even in Africa!
2.	It was only after we sought police assistance and started to ring the Unlawful interference bell, her duty was passed on to another agent and the flight could be dispatched. Both of the ladie’s colleagues that took her duty over were exceptional, extremely helpful, very professional and competent as is my experience with all previous TXL visits.
3.	If I, during any of my subsequent turnarounds find the flight being handled by that same agent I may, in fulfilling my ultimate duty of assuring absolute safety and flawless traffic to our valued customers, require her immediate relief and a substitute handling agent.

After departure, climbing through 4000 ft, we got R Bleed Duct warning message. The message remained red for more than 30 seconds and then we were left with both engine bleeds closed. Bleeds remained off for a few minutes. We continued climb to FL100 while monitoring cabin pressure. After a few minutes it was possible to reset the remaining bleed and get pressurization back. We continued climb to FL270.
After 5 minutes, at approx. FL200, red R Bleed Duct message reoccurred and all bleeds were automatically closed.  Cabin rate was moderate 500 fpm while initial cabin altitude was still relatively low. We requested descend. At approx. FL 140 pressurization/ventilation was reestablished, due to icing conditions climb to FL 170 and later to FL210 was requested.
After another 5 minutes R Bleed Duct reoccurred, and we diverted back to airport of departure. Period of red indication was longer; we requested descent to FL 100. Cabin rate was also at this time 500 fpm and descent was expedited. After a few minutes red duct indication disappeared and then it was possible to reestablish cabin pressurization/ventilation. Approx. max cabin altitude was 5500 ft. Remaining flight was conducted in non-icing IMC conditions at FL100.
During flight ATC did inquire whether we want to declare emergency and later whether we want priority. We didn’t need either.
Duct Mon Fault status message was not present anymore after landing.

2118962,SR-0002-2018,Unruly passenger,Flight AMS LJU,"Na letu iz Ams je potnica TINA NEMARNIK grozila posadki in vznemirjala s svoijm nasilnim in zmedenim vedenjem potnike in posadko na tem letu.
Med boardingom sem imela zelo veliko opraviti z rocno prtljago, saj ta ni bila oznacena pri nobenem potniku, zato so jo vztrajno nosili gor (drugo porocilo), zato kaksnega posebnega neprimernega obnasanja tam nisem opazila, sem pa opazila, da je imela eno zelo veliko prtljago, ki jo je brez tezav pustila pred letalom. Tudi med vstopom v letalo in demonstracijo je bilo vse b.p. Ko sem delala final check, me je ustavila in vprasala, ce je njena prtljaga vkrcana in sem ji rekla, da ce jo je oddala kot ročno, prav gotovo je. Rekla je, da je to velik kovcek in da ima zelo pomembne stvari notri. Vprasala sem jo, ali ima kaksno napravo vkljuceno ali kaj takega v kovcku in je rekla: A bi potem kdo klical, da je bomba v letalu? Zacudeno sem jo pogledala in rekla, da se naj nikakor ne sali s takimi besedami in jo vprasala, kaj ima v kovcku. Rekla je: ""samo salim se, v kovcku so samo papirji in dokumenti"". V tej fazi ni bila niti nasilna, niti agresivna in ni vec komentirala..
Po FSB off, ko sva zeleli s kolegico zaceti s servisom, je prisla v kuhinjo in zacela sprasevati, ce je njen kovcek v letalu in spet sem ji rekla, da rocne prtlajge nikoli ne pustimo. Potem je zacela stopnjevati glas in groziti, da se ji bo ""strgalo"", ce ne bo njene prtlajage na tleh in da bomo videli, kaj bo. Pozvala sem jo, naj se takoj usede, ce ne, bom obvestila kapitana, vendar je se vedno grozila... Odpeljala sem jo na njen sedez in sla obvestiit kapitana. Kapitan mi je rekel, da ji v primeru, da se enkrat grozi, recem, da bomo pristali v FRA ali MUC in jo bo tam cakala policija. Ker se je v tistem trenutku umirila, sva sli s kolegico s servisom in ko sva prisli do nje z vozickom, je vstala in se odpravila naprej. Sla sem za njo in jo vprasala, kam gre, in je rekla, da na wc in ali ji mislim se to prepovedati. Sla je v wc in ko sem sla proti vozičku, mi je ze mahala kolegica. Takoj sem sla do nje, saj se je namenila v kuhinjo in jo vprasala, kam gre. Rekla je, da gre gledat skozi okno. Fizično sem se postavila pred njo in jo pozvala, naj se takoj usede in opozorila, kot je rekel kapitan, da bomo zasilno pristali v FRA, kjer jo bo cakala policija. Rekla je, da si to zeli in da si zeli v FRA. Se vedno se ni zelela usesti, zato sem jo potiskala proti njenemu sedezu. Vmes je zacela naglas govoriti potnikom, da gremo v FRA, ker so njej ukradli prtljago. Ker se sama ni hotela usesti, sem jo potiskala proti sedezu.  Ko se je koncno usedla, sem ji rekla, naj se takoj priveze in naj ostane na sedezu. Kapitana sva nenehno obvescali. Potnika na 3B, Nizozemca, sem prosila, da bi mi v primeru, da se enkrat prIstopi proti kuhinji, pomga, da ji to onemogocim. Potem sem se odlocila, da grem do nje, usedla sem se na sedez poleg, jo prijela za roko in mirno vprasala, cesa jo je strah in kaj ima v prtljagi. Rekla je da ima dokumente, ki bodo razkrili korupcijo v Sloveniji in bo slo v zapor pol Slovenije...Rekla sem ji, da ji obljubim, da bom v primeru, da njenega kovcka ne bo, osebno sla z njo na LL in da bo sigurno dobila kovcek. Po tistem se je pomirila in samo se 2x rekla, da skoda, da ne gremo v FRA. S kapitaom sva se odlocila, da bomo pristali v LJU in da jo tam pričaka policija. Do pristanka je bila mirna.
Dogovorili smo se, da ostali potniki zapustijo letalo in jo policija pocaka  na mostu. Ko je zapuščala letalo, se je obnasala, kot da ni bilo nič in pozdravila ob izhodu. Ostali potniki so bili glede na situacijo precej mirni, čeprav situacija ni bila prijetna ne za njih, ne za posadko.
Po izkrcanju smo sli na policijo, kjer smo dali uradno izjavo. Policaji so nam povedali, da so bili v prtljagi papirji. Za kaksen prekrsek jo bodo ovadili, ni znano.
Potnica očitno trpi za paranojo in psihičnimi motnjami, zato mislim, da jo je potrebno dati na listo, da ji v bodoče onemogočimo vstop v naša letala.

Upon our departure from CDG RWY 08L on a LANVI departure RNAV-1 SID, aircraft developed a left bank tendency while manually flown by CM1.
As this happened quite early after take-off, I could not determine whether the reason was poor piloting (due to possible illusion), wake turbulence of the preceding departing aircraft or lift irregularity due to anti-icing treatment.
I immediately challenged the bank with call-out and verbal correction advice. As right crosswind was blowing, this worsened the situation, because the bank further increased the lateral deviation from the track (not that apparent at the moment of event). Right bank should be used to correct the track, but aircraft banked again to the left in a slow manner (probably by CM1). As I challenged bank for the second time, I was at time ready to intervene and take controls, but ATC already gave us immediate heading of 15deg to the right (because we probably entered the buffer area for separation with traffic from RWY 09R), which we immediately complied with.

At the time of event I could not be sure whether it was a controllability or illusion issue, so I considered my duty to be assisting CM1 in safe aviating of aircraft.
I would appriciate finding out how much cross-track error was caused, by the means of analyzing the recorded data from the aircraft (S5-AAY).

As additional information I would like to stress, that same aircraft on our first sector that day posted autopilot aileron trim caution, but only on PFD. I avoided this on my two sectors with RWD aileron trim before engaging the autopilot. CM1 was informed about my actions every time I was PF.

Several times left spoileron could be seen partially deployed on CRJ-700 aircraft (few millimeters - not shown on flight controls synoptic page of the EICAS display) during walkaround, but is completely stowed after introduction of HYD pressure.

2040696,SOR-0238-2017,Extremely non-cooperative ATC (Zagreb West sector FL 400 early morning),Europe and North Atlantic - Croatia / Zagreb Western sector FL400 / JP727,"To appreciate economics of the flight, we decided to depart TIA with mere 150 kg extra fuel earlier today all IAW the OM, other legislation, careful weather analysis and based on previous experience of both flight crew members. All went well until reaching Zagreb West Sector FL400 and coming into conflict with two other LJU bound ADR flights. Initially we were kindly asked whether we could increase the speed to M .80 (without being informed of becoming ""number 1 for approach"") to which we responded with ""negative"" as the parameter picking needed to remain exact.

It is my strong opinion this was understood by the controller as our intentional noncooperation mandating his immediate retaliation. We were to become ""number 2 for approach"" by deviating grossly from a direct route and were being literally ""shot from the sky"" despite our clear request to stay at the cruising level for 20 NM more. The reason for the rapid premature descent was given to us as ""conflicting traffic"" that we never saw on TCAS and never met despite keeping an extremely shallow descent angle.

Even after informing Zagreb ATC that further deviations were unacceptable due to ""slightly above minimum fuel for landing"" status, we could not get their cooperation. Instead they escalated the situation further by bluntly asking if were declaring emergency. Despite us replying with a clear ""negative"" they without justification proceeded with escalation by informing the next ATC sector (LJLA) of a dubious fuel status for our flight.

Kindly note that it is my strong opinion that Zagreb ATC with their course of action today represented a wrong, direct interference with operation of a flight causing unjustified obstructing rather than facilitating its progress. As a participant there and then, based on my experience from all other ATC sectors I judge performance of Zagreb West Sector FL400 today early in the morning as a complete failure.

V prilogi tudi moj plan letenja od 7. oktorba do 15. oktobra.
Planiranje na letenje s reporting time 03.20 LT v LJU in nato napotitev s Ground transportom v VCE, nato trije sektorj:i VCE-VIE-VCE-VIE s check out-om ob 12.28 LT, ter cca 20 minutni transfer do hotela Penta. Kljub, izčrpanosti sem prvi dan nekako zvozil. V hotelu smo bili okoli 13.00 LT, check out pa naslednji dan ob 11.20 LT, torej 22.20 urni počitek. Kljub zadostnemu počitku so se mi  problemi, zaradi urujenosti začeli pojavljati drugi dan. Drugi dan odhod iz hotela ob 11.20 LT nato 5 sektorjev: VIE - WAW - VIE - PRG - VIE - VCE, pristanek na VCE ob 22.10LT, nato ground transfer v LJU, kamor smo prišli ob 00.55LT. Zaradi utrujenosti sem imel težave s koncetracijo, izbiro pravih FCP - A/P modov, delal sem napake pri komunikaciji s ATC-jem, težave z navigiranje med vožnjo po leališču. Ker je letalo, ki smo ga prevzeli zamujalo iz VCE zaradi megle, smo posledično imeli tudi mi zamudo, ki je nismo uspeli nadoknaditi do konca delovnega dne. Ves čas smo noreli, da bi nadoknadili zamudo, jedel - zbasal sem obrok med letenjem, premalo sem bil hidriran, kar je po mojem mnenju doprineslo še dodatno k utrujenosti. Takšna operacija predstavlja po mojem mnenju varnostno tveganje. Predlagam, da se posadko pošlje en dan prej v VCE in se jih nastani v hotel, tako da začnejo z letenjem spočiti.",0,2

Last couple of days most of them were also connected with a lot of bad and stressfull weather on arrivals and departures. On the last day 4 sectors were planned. First destination was Frankfurt and second one was Munich. But after landing at Frankfurt flight dispatch called us and changed evening flight to Munich with Copenhagen. By that time i felt ok with that change although that meant longer flight time and actualy no time for at least short rest during turnaround. 

Nevertheless we departed from Ljubljana to Copenhagen already with delay. ETD to CPH was less than 15 minutes after our landing. We had to change the aircraft (sec. search and refueling) and cabin crew as well. During flight to Copenhagen i felt already some sort of tiredness, my role was pilot monitoring. 
Turnaround at Copenhagen was also very demanding, since we were trying to reduce the delay. There was also problem with refueling truck which caused additional delay. To minimize the delay, we decided to perform refueling with pax on board.  After refueling we departed with 10minutes off delay anyway. I was pilot flying. Shortly after take off from Copenhagen i complained to captain that i couldn't remember that we received take-off clearance and also had difficulties with allertness. Therefore we decided that captain takes over the controls and continues as pilot flying and he performed the landing as well.
In my opinion there was too many sectors for this time period (12days) and that the last minute changes contributed a lot to additional fatigue. Two days off are certanly not enough to get proper rest. Especially after all request for vacations are denied. Now i regret that i accepted the flight to Copenhagen.",0,4

Since we were very light (less that 25000 kg) and thus good performance I decided not to retract flaps nor gear to not unstabilze the flight. We climb to about 1000ft AGL and at that time we were already at position to start descend for landing. We increased speed to be on safe side for base and final turns and performed normal visual traffic pattern for RW12. We were stabilized on final at app 700 ft AGL. Normal landing was performed and we vacated via G.
Approach was stabilized all the time. Due very late notification of wind and thus some time required for arrangment with ATC we needed to climb a little bit to be than able to normally join traffic pattern for visual RW12.
Trainee acted as PM during whole flight, I was PF and so fact that it was anyway training flight, this has no influence on performance during the approach.",0,4

Poklicani so bili gasilci, ki so vrečo premestili na varno mesto za nevarno blago.

Varnosti list razvršča to razpršilo med nevarno blago, UN1789 hydrocloric acid (klorovodikova kislina).

1644254,SG-0001-2014,Airbus LPC Takeoff Performance module,ADR 915,"In takeoff performance calculation one of the inputs is runway state. This is divided into several conditions (dry, wet or contaminated with different types and depths of contaminant). For takeoff (and landing) performance calculation, a runway 
covered with certain types and depths of contaminants may be considered as a wet runway. For instance, a runway covered with less than 3 mm of dry snow may be considered as a wet runway for takeoff performance calculation. Dry snow 
can be present on the runway at very low temperatures, well below -10 degrees C. However, in Airbus LPC Takeoff Performance module, a wet runway may only be selected for temeratures down to -5 degrees C. The takeoff performance 
calculation can thus only be performed assuming either a dry runway (thereby reducing the safety margin) or a contaminated runway (increasing the safety margin but putting more strain on the engines as takeoff must be performed using TOGA 
thrust).

I suggest removing the -5 degree C limitation for wet runway calculation using LPC Takeoff Performance Module.

Right reverser become available at once (icon green) but the left one remained unavailable (icon yellow). I was not able to fully deploy left reverser as it was blocked somehow.Few attempts were made to unlock it then I realised a malfanction is happening. I fully deployed the right reverser and continued to stop the aircreft on the rwy. Stopping was succeful and we vacated the rwy 06R at intersection A17. At that point both reversers were stoved.During taxi I have tried several times to deploy left reverser but was unsucessful. No messages on EICAS was shown but yellow icon on N1 parameter.On the parking position I have tried for the last time to deploy reverser and was succesful. Both icon green. I have had a major disscusion with LMLD and followed his instructions. Decision was made to execute a normal flight to LJLJ since there was no EICAS messages no faults detected at mintenace page. I have also started both engines at parking position and tried several times to deploy thrust reverser and all attempts were succesful.

We have stared our duty at 18:20UTC with a crew bus from hotel to the airport.
It is obviously planned as a split duty and hotel accommodation is provided in KIV - Chisinau. After landing in KIV, cleaning and securing the aircraft (21:44 + 0:20), the handling agent gave us an information, that usually takes up to 40 minutes for the crew to get to the hotel, including transportation to the terminal, passport control, walking to the hotel multivan and transport to the hotel in the centre of Chisinau. We have calculated as well at least 10 minutes of check in in the hotel before we are able to take rest in our rooms. (This would be 22:04 + 0:50 = 22:54UTC)
Pick up from the hotel is organised (flight documentation included in the folder for AUA operations) 1h 30 minutes before flight, which means we have active rest in the hotel of (2:30 - 1:30 = 0:30 UTC, 22:04 >> 0:30 = 2h 26min ??

I am scheduled after landing in Vienna to wait for 2h at the airport, where I can't take a nap in uniform between the  other passengers, fly to Ljubljana, where we landed at 7:14 and after getting my suitcase from the belt it was 7:50 UTC when I was in front of my car to drive home for 1h35min.

This is reality of our operation and despite I'm aware, that some crew members in the past requested on their last day in the block to go home earlier, such planning to my opinion isn't in accordance with the regulation and split duty requirements. On top of that I'm scheduled the next day at 4:00 UTC on 4 legs training flight with the FO candidate!? 
If a proper rest in the hotel would be assured for me in VIE, such early check in on the next day wouldn't be possible, because I could start earliest at 10:30...

Please investigate if such crew planning is in accordance with requirements and send me a feedback if possible.

1678440,ADR MOR-0068-2014,Flight Plan Filed Through Uncontrolled Airspace,50 nm SE of EGNV,"The Company filed our Flight Plan via ATS route UL602 to OTR VOR, then direct to destination. As 
we were descending towards the destination and passing FL195, ATC advised us we were leaving 
controlled airspace and asked us which service we required.  We requested Deconfliction Service, 
as per CRAR UK. 

I want to point out that it is impossible to get into EGNV without flying in uncontrolled airspace. 
Even if the Company had filed the flight plan the long way around, along ATS Route P18, the lower 
limit of which is FL110, we would still be in uncontrolled airspace between FL110 and 6000 ft 
(where EGNV Class D Airspace starts). And since 99% of all VFR traffic flies below 10000 ft, there 
is, for all practical purposes, no safety related difference between the two options. 

Also, the Deconfliction Service in UK airspace provides an equivalent level of safety for IFR traffic 
in uncontrolled airspace when compared with Class E airspace in which we are allowed to fly. The 
main threat in both classes of airspace is VFR traffic, which is not required to participate in the ATC 
system. 

To summarize, we flew the route in uncontrolled airspace, which was filed by the Company. This 
means to me that a special authorization was granted by the Flight Operations Manager in 
advance, as required by OM(A) 8.3.1.5.. However, since a copy of the Authorization was not 
attached to the Flight Folder, the fact that we would be flying in uncontrolled airspace was not 
immediately obvious. The second problem is, ours was the second flight in two days to the same 
destination and this comprises a »series of flights«, which, in turn, according to OM(A) 8.3.1.5., 
should have prompted an issuance in Airport Briefing and/or Operational Directive.

own predicament. But the really paradoxical thing is that before when we
didn't have crew meals, stress and frustration among the crew wasn't so

The scheduled departure of ground transport from LJU to INN was 07:40 local time. After standard pre-flight duties in the Operations Centre we departed at 07:55.  The journey took us 5 h to arrive at INN airport. En-route we stopped only once for ~15 to 20 minutes for physiological needs and there were no major traffic jams. Then we needed another ~ 15 minutes to get to the aircraft. 
So we departed the first flight with a delay.
Even though it is all legal, my opinion is that this kind of planning of such a long gnd transport just before the flight duty is inadequate. Taking into account as well the INN apt as a very demanding C category airport. The same means for the gnd transport after the flight duty from INN. 
At least it should be planned more time for the gnd transport, or plan to get a crew to INN the evening before the flight.

After that it was keep coming on for several more times. Other engine parameters oil press readout, oil temp and quantity was again normal. We did the QRH. After consideration, we decided to return to LJU. 
Maintenance performed MEL 79-30-01 (M) action - disabling Low press sensor. 
Thereafter we departed LJU inbound OTP for a second time.
The same message came back on (with oil press sensor disabled) after 16 minutes of flight. Since it was obviously faulty indication, we continued to OTP. 
The message kept coming on for many more times, so we decided to silence annoying repetitive aural messages it by disabling DCUs. They were returned to normal before 10.000 ft, as briefed.
Landing uneventful. On same day we had other HIL (sensors related) items: Service door indication U/S, overboard cool fail.


The same situation repeated its self for all next 3 legs with some similarities:
R  ENG OIL PRESS was never displayed on ground (running or shut off eng - after sensor was disabled.)
It came on after T/O (16 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 minutes), that is few minutes after we entered temperatures below 0.
It stayed on for different amount of time (between 3s and few minutes, mostly around 15s). Also the time when it was not on was different.
This cycling took around 10 minutes, after that, in cruise there was no indication anymore, until descend. 
It was again more frequent in low levels (below 5000ft). Sometimes it came on with turbulence and pitch change (start of descend).
It seems not to be connected with thrust changes (it came on when thrust was stable, or it did not come on when we change it).

Each of them showed fatigue on the 3 and 4 day of WOCL-flying and fatigue on marginal conditions which means a hazard/risk to flight ops!
Also I would like to emphasize that all this is in PRN where no stby option is avaiable and so the psychological pressure is enormous and big problems arise if a flight crew member reports UNFIT TO FLY even if it is due to poor/extreme scheduling!

There have been audit findings related to new aircraft implementation and crew fatigue which were not resolved in more than a year fo time. SAAB implementation was done without coordinated project management processes, without relevant information flow, without assignment of responsibility and authority and without SMS management principles. If parts of necessary processes were performed, they were done with a pressure to formalize already accomplished facts.
At present time there is no authority assigned to personnel with operational expertize to take decisions.  Factual organization of the Flight Operations is different from that published in company documentation and those posing a risk to effective mitigation of risks.
As a consequence, there is a lack of resources, time pressure and last but not the least a financial risk to operations with a reverse impact on safety.

During app to SJJ ATIS reported 10+ kts tail wind for RWY12 landing. PF was CM2. we have  also briefed for visual app for RWY30. Downwind altitude was established to be at 3500ft QNH. After leaving the ILS12, the controller gave us landing clearance with wind reading for RWY30 (280/9) that distracted me because RWY12 wind was 280/15/max26. We were still in position to perform visual straight in for RWY12 and as I asked controller for wind conformation PF already started turn towards RWY12 (we both agreed at that moment that we are able to land RWY12). The controller confirmed wind for RWY12 as before (commenting that is varying). At that time, I decided that we have to make a GA and that was performed. During GA, while calling GA to ATC I noticed that we were leveling off (than calling to PF, don't descent), than climb was established. After initial turn we received vectors for ILS followed by visual for RWY30.
As we were established on ILS, I asked CM2 if he is OK and able to perform app. His reply was that he is OK. I also commented, that I prefer him flying, because he will be able to see the RWY all the time. After leaving the ILS we received landing clearance and established altitude 3500ft QNH on downwind. Landing chklist was read to FLAPS. I guided CM2 with directions regarding terrain and direction to fly because of crosswind on that altitude. Full landing configuration was selected prior to final turn and landing chklist for FLAPS right after. During final turn, ROD was up to 1200ft/min. I called RATE. When the turn was that far that I could see the RWY, I told CM2 that we are OK on the glide path and that he can reduce rate. Than I told CM2 that there is displaced threshold and asked if he sees it. He replied yes. Than we were below optimum glide path and we got GPWS DONT SINK. We landed about 100m before displaced threshold.

1. I should have flown the visual app myself due to demanding terrain or at least take over controls on final.
2. Displaced threshold marking on RWY30 are extremely poor.

(It took some more time as usually to set the Idle Open Descend, so I think at that point there was some distraction already present). 
I am sure I have seen the FMA ""Idle Open Descend"" on FMA, checked the cleared FL and checked the new mode. At that time as far as I can now remember, I was busy with some assisting work, I think (sorry but I am not sure), I was listening to the ATIS on the second radio set. Both of us were unaware that the acft started climbing! After some time (now I see that this was after ~1 min), I am sure I noticed the unusually low speed and reacted with the words: ""...we have to descend!"" At that time capt on training pulled the alt knob again and we started the Idle Open Descend. The acft entered the normal descend.
There was no warning, neither any kind of call from ATC.  
There was some distraction causing the overlook of the unusual acft parameters - altitide.
No problem with CRM, just I think it was a mistake in setting V/S to +1500 fpm instead of -1500fpm! Maybe caused by a rotary V/S selector (right turn and left turn), to which the capt on training was not very well accustomed to. (comparing to drum type V/S selector).
Deficiency in my monitoring: I was satisfied with the first check when I saw the initially set mode: Idle Open Descend and have not checked the flight mode annunciator any more for ~1 min. And in monitoring the other parameters: altitude.
Lessons to be learned: read strictly and loudly the Flt Modes from FMA for PF and check and confirm modes on FMA by PM. Be careful to take a moment and really read it from the FMA!!!!

2365807,SOR-0146-2019,Touchdown before displaced threshold at LQSA RWY 30,"Europe and North Atlantic - Bosnia and Herzegovina / LQSA, Sarajevo  / JP700","Due to a tailwind of over 10 knots straight-in landing on RWY 12 in LQSA was not possible. After 1st attempt a go around was executed partly also due misunderstanding of the wind value given by the tower ATC two times each time differently (1st time for the threshold 12 and 2nd time for threshold 30). 

During 2nd attempt out of ILS12 approach a visual approach - right traffic pattern for RWY 30 was executed. As the weather was CAVOK and with almost no turbulence we with CPT decided that I (FO) will remain acting as pilot flying due better visibility of the RWY from the right side of cockpit. It was my first such approach in LQSA. RWY30 has a displaced threshold of 500m for landing (but not for takeoff) and the painting of the runway markings is in a very poor condition. Additionally, together with slight sun reflection from the RWY I did not correctly identified the displaced landing threshold and hence I aimed for the touchdown too short down the physical RWY. A landing was made around 50-100m (guessing) before the landing threshold. 

Fuel was not a factor as we had enough fuel to return to LJLJ later on (and even with an extra of around 400kg).

On 10.12. the weather was better (CAT 1) but approximately at the same time as previous night (on last approach to OTP) I felt rapid increase (10 min after start to descend) of progressing tiredness. I operating as PM (Monitoring Pilot) I think that on landing I wasn't capable to land aircraft safely according aviation standards. I was lucky that that night weather was on our side. I can't imagine if we had to execute LVO landing as previous night. I'm sure, that I was in state of partial incapacitation in last 10 minutes (time, flight progress awareness and scanning cycle due fatigue). I’m also sure that fatigue was consequence of late finishes, which disrupted the sleep opportunity during the optimal sleep time window.",0,4

The weather was partially cloudy but the wind was (on ground) 40 knot with 55 knot gust.  Knowing the wind components we decide during the briefing to add 10knot on VREF for the approach. And CM1 briefed the procedure in case of windshear.

Pilot flying was CM2 during the approach. At around 2000 ft to 1500 ft while fully configured CM2 gave control to CM1. Before transferring the control the IAS was oscillating between speedbug Magnus 5knot to bug plus 20 knot with N1 between 50 to 75%. At 1000 ft we were stabilised. CM1 disconnect autopilot. At around 800ft/600ft the aircraft banked to around 10 degree to the right then the flight director went up and down and left very fast.

From the information the crew gathered and the cokpit fuel page working normally, when we arrived at the airplane, there was no reason for us to suspect anything was wrong. The airplane had already been refueled. 

For the third flight, the F/O set the auto refuel (as we had set it on the previous flight, where it worked normally) and 6400 kg as a target. The system did not stop auto refuel, when the right tank was at 3200kg. F/O tried manual refuel mode, but that did also not close the right wing refuel valve. In the end the petrollier stop the refuelling. About 20 liters (according to the firefighters¨ info) of fuel overspilled from the right wing overspill pipe on stand 4.

2275315,SR-0074-2018,unfit to fly due to extreme level of fatique,JP 704/705,"On November the 2nd I have declared ""unfit-to-fly"" for flight JP704/705. The reason for this was extremely high level of fatique.

I have woken up around 10 AM, still feeling very tired. Even the thought of coming to work within 1 hour was at that moment for me unbearable. I can't even imagine how I'd react if I came to work anyway, or how I would (not) react in the case of any emergency. This was my 5th work day in a row and I had every single day 4 or even 5 legs. The rest between the flights was just roughly above 12 hours. The rest from October the 30th  to October the 31st was after 5 legs roughly a few minutes above the minimum rest. So it is logical that my body was overly exhausted on the 5th day with the rooster like this. The level of fatique is simply too high with a rooster like this and completely unacceptable..

Another reason  that contributed to my ""unfit to fly"" is the fact that I have just came from the sick leave. I was in my bed with antibiotics for 8 days and coming to work and work to such extend with a rooster like this was not helping the body to recover from illness  and get the power back either. 

I honestly miss the fact that human factor is not taken into consideration when making a rooster. It happens way too often than coming to work after sick leave or vacation the rooster ""is killing"". I wonder if this is made on purpose?

Anyway, in the attachment  you will find my original rooster for those 5 days, from which it can be seen that I had  21 sectors and and 55 hours (56 hours in 7 days is a maximum!!) on my plan.

Thank you for your time.

2582052,SOR-0505-2019,Brake temperature monitoring system,Europe and North Atlantic - Germany - Stuttgart (BW) / EDDS / DLH2151,"During the acceptance of the aircraft, we were briefed by the outgoing crew about the abnormal heating of the no. 2 brake. The taxi-out (MUC) and taxi-in (STR) were uneventful. During the taxi-out (STR), the aircraft was accelerating at idle thrust due to low take-off weight (approx. 30 t) and downslope (RW25 in use, parking position 45). Outside air temperature was 23 C. Moderate braking was required to ensure the appropriate taxi speed (maximum BTMS value before the taxi-out was 3). Given the information passed on by the previous crew, right brake was used more frequently than the left. As we were approaching RW25 holding point, one aircraft was lining up and another one was on final RW25. Brake no. 3 BTMS value at that point was 5. We were instructed to hold short of the runway. The BTMS value increased to 6. Just before the touch down of the landing aircraft, BTMS value increase to 7 (white). We cancelled the line up clearance and released the parking brake  (which was set at the time), while pressing on the left brake pedal in order to speed up cooling of the right brake assembly. After approx. 12 minutes there was no change in the BTMS value (7). As one other aircraft was approaching our holding position, we had to decide whether to enter the active runway and vacate it at the nearest taxiway and thus further increase the brake temperature (and incur additional delay which would cause the passengers to miss their connecting flights) or take-off. We discussed the situation and came to the conclusion that the airstream during the take-off roll would likely speed up the cooling of the affected brake so we opted for the take-off. At 90 knots IAS, all BTMS values were green and the take-off roll was uneventful. Still wind conditions likely contributed to the long cooling time as well as somewhat unusual behaviour of the BTMS noticed during the subsequent flights (value increasing to 7 than decreasing to 5 and increasing again to 7 in the span of 10 minutes).",0,1

Takeoff thrust was used with ambient temperature 27 deg and bleeds on eng. Returned to stand and LMLD Adria Tehnika asistance was requested. According to AAT LMLD statement visual inspection from licensed manintenance engeneer is required to perform return flight. Engeneer with one time permission was arraged with cooperation with AAT and ZRH handling agent.

Due to doubts of his statements I made decision that visual inspection shall be performed by engeneer. Return flight with passangers uneventful.,0,1
2599827,SOR-0561-2019,Bad usage or missusage of MEL,Europe and North Atlantic - Germany / Munich,"The airplane has partialy inoperative Hydraulic Pump Low Pressure Switch, which means that caution massage doesnt show continously but is shoving spuriously, at least 10 times per minute, always accompanied with caution massage chime and light on push button. In MEL we have operation procedure just for continously shown massage.
It is extremely stressful and dangerous if sporious Caution Warning turns on every 5 to 10 seconds in all phases of flight and taxi (except when warnings are inhibit) 
Airplane with that type of fault should be repaird or changed ASAP, which was not the case in this case days after troubleshotting, fault was still in MEL and airplane operating on the outbase.
Waiting to the last day of repair inerval limit, altough aoc was informed about concerns from several pilots is a very bad practise of the company. I think that kind of practise is a serrious safety issue.
